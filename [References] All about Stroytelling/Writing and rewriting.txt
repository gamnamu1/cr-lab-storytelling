TO INSTRUCTORS


_Writing and Rewriting_ is based on the conviction that college freshmen
can be taught to see and to correct their own errors and faults.

Criticism by means of marginal numbers, referring to pieces of advice
in a rhetoric or a manual, has long been utilized to economize the
instructor’s time. It has not been generally realized, however, that
this method, which requires the student to inspect and rewrite a faulty
sentence in the light of an illustration in his book, is successful
also in teaching him to rewrite faulty sentences before he submits his
manuscript to his instructor.

The best device to encourage the student in self-correction is the
preliminary copy or rough draft. This may be written rapidly in pencil on
theme paper or on scratch paper, with lines far apart to leave room for
modifications. After this is written the student should read it with his
eyes open for the appearance of his pet blunders, and should do his own
rewriting. If the rough draft is submitted with the finished copy, the
instructor can discover whether the student is endeavoring to correct his
own faults.

The best way to use _Writing and Rewriting_ in class is to copy the
faulty passages or to clip and paste them on cards. In class the student,
using only the slip, may then be required to write the correct version on
the blackboard, later reciting and specifying the fault, or the principle
of style which is violated.

In colleges where the marginal numbering of errors and faults is
supplemented by personal conferences, the swiftest improvement will
be found to follow the practice of requiring the student, before the
conference, to copy his faulty passages on a new sheet of theme paper, to
copy also the admonition indicated by the marginal number, and to rewrite
each passage in accordance with the admonition. A file of these sheets
will reveal whether the student is improving or standing still.

_Writing and Rewriting_ has several relatively novel features. Chapters
IV and V make it possible to criticize by marginal numbers the most
common violations of the principles of the whole composition and of the
paragraph. Although the admonitions criticize faults, the book contains
few “don’ts.” Instead, the advice given is positive, constructive, and
concrete. Each number refers to only a single fault. Few admonitions
fill more than two lines of type. It has thus been possible to insert a
criticism of every fundamental fault found in freshman themes. Probably
every number ought to be used at least once in every hundred themes. The
division of sentence criticisms into chapters on Correctness, Clearness,
and Vigor is logical and obvious. The numbering of admonitions is not
consecutive, but a new hundred begins with each chapter as a help in
more quickly locating the number desired. Additional copies of the index
to the admonitions will be furnished free on request to instructors who
wish to paste it on a sheet of cardboard to facilitate their work in
criticizing themes. The list of suggestions for subjects is a compilation
of the practices of many successful teachers.

WRITING AND REWRITING




CHAPTER I

WHY LEARN TO WRITE


The four main reasons for learning to write are:

1. Writing is one of the best ways to make other persons think or feel as
you do.

2. Every educated person is judged frequently and severely by the
correctness and skill displayed in his writing.

3. The more you learn about writing the more you will enjoy reading.

4. Good writing gives pleasure, not only to the reader but also to the
writer.

       *       *       *       *       *

1. The ability to write clearly and convincingly will be of great help
to you after you leave college. Whatever your field of activity, your
ultimate success will depend in some degree on your ability to make other
persons think or feel as you do. Writing is one of the best ways to
attain this end.

Many professional men and women find that success depends not only on
their knowledge, but even more on the skill and clearness with which
they can present their knowledge. Lawyers write briefs and arguments.
Judges write opinions. Clergymen write sermons. Teachers, doctors, and
engineers get their new ideas before members of their professions by
writing papers for publications of various kinds. The results of their
experiments and researches are almost invariably presented to their
colleagues in writing.

To attain eminence in one of the learned professions it is necessary for
a man’s colleagues to think highly of his professional knowledge and
attainments. It is not always possible for the leaders in your profession
to know you personally, but if you can write they soon know what manner
of man you are. The scholarly articles that a young professional man gets
printed correspond to the home runs that are knocked by a bush league
baseball player, but there is this difference. The sand lot baseball
player may have made his impressive looking records against sand lot
pitching and may fail dismally when he faces better opposition, but if a
young professional man has the mental ability and the skill to produce
contributions to knowledge in his field it makes no difference where
he lives or under what conditions he has done his work. As he moves up
to his big league he finds conditions more and more favorable for his
continued growth and development.

College graduates everywhere are being expected more and more to assume
positions of leadership in all matters that pertain to community
betterment. Sometimes they are candidates for office; more often they
are directors of the chamber of commerce of their city, or of some
similar civic enterprise. Written statements, annual reports, appeals
for public support for a worthy cause, letters to newspapers, circulars,
and bulletins are almost the only way a public spirited citizen can get
his ideas before the other members of the community. If he can write
clearly and convincingly he gets things done that would not be done if
he expressed himself haltingly and incoherently when he took pen in hand.

Up-to-date farmers and business men use printed and typewritten matter
to get new business, to hold and increase old business, to adjust
complaints, and to collect money. Every salesman has to write reports to
his firm. Formal bids for all kinds of business are submitted in writing.
Most busy executives prefer to receive the ideas of their subordinates
in writing, and the subordinate who submits the largest number of good
ideas in this way is the one who is likely to be promoted most rapidly.
Many executives have to depend on letters and bulletins in directing
large numbers of subordinates or in directing subordinates who cannot
frequently be brought together. If you want to be paid for what you know
rather than for what you do, learn to write.

Other things being anywhere nearly equal the man who can write gets ahead
fastest in the business, political, or professional world. The man with
a new idea—whether it is a new type of automobile engine or a plan for
insuring hogs—can make a success of it far more quickly if he can write
clearly and convincingly. The next time you see a copy of _Who’s Who
in America_ note the list of publications that follows the name of the
successful man. The ability to write has dollar and cents value whether
or not you ever wish to sell any of your manuscripts. You must be able to
write to get to the top.

       *       *       *       *       *

2. Why do you suppose that almost every help wanted advertisement that
offers a salary of more than $1200 or $1500 a year contains the phrase,
“Apply by letter only”? The answer is that from one hundred letters it is
easy to select the half dozen or so that come from persons qualified for
a position rather than for a job. Applicants who write poor letters are
never considered for good positions.

The activities of the social world continually call for letters—letters
of invitation, of acceptance or declination, letters to a hostess
thanking her for her hospitality, letters of congratulation and of
condolence. Any new person to whom you write will judge what sort of man
or woman you are from your first letter. Uneducated persons may have well
furnished houses in the exclusive residential districts of the city,
and they may wear thousand-dollar fur coats, but their written words
betray the fact that they are not accustomed to associating with educated
persons.

Students who can write get better grades in college courses than do
students who cannot express themselves with pen, pencil, or typewriter.
Written reports, term papers, and examinations all call for ability to
write. It is essential not only to have the information that should
be included in such compositions but also to be able to express your
knowledge so that the instructor involved will know that you know.

       *       *       *       *       *

3. The better you write the more you will enjoy reading. You can actually
know personally only a few persons, and they will for the most part be
your neighbors and business associates. A love for good reading is the
best friend you can have. Reading will make you intimate with all the
great men and women who are now alive or who have ever lived. These great
ones of earth—the clever, the entertaining, the thoughtful, the lovable,
the brilliant, the courageous—have set down in books a permanent record
of what they observed, thought, and dreamed. To get the fullest flavor
and greatest benefit from the words they have put on paper you need to
be something of a writer yourself. The writer best appreciates the good
writing of others, just as the amateur musician gets more pleasure from
a symphony concert than does the average person in the audience. The
football player sees fine points in a football game that are lost on
the spectator who never tried to box a tackle or elude an end. The girl
who makes her own clothes can see distinctions in gowns that all look
alike to her brother. It takes the craftsman in any field of endeavor to
appreciate the work of a master.

       *       *       *       *       *

4. Your mother has, at the bottom of a trunk or bureau drawer, a bundle
of letters that your father wrote to her when they were young. Every
little while she reads them all again. She also keeps the letters he
writes her now when he is away from home. Your letters to your mother
will not be destroyed either. The better you write, the more pleasure
you will give to the persons you love. Letters of commendation,
congratulation, or condolence when done well are treasured for years, and
are a never failing source of pleasure to those who receive them. It is
worth something to give pleasure of this sort.

       *       *       *       *       *

But the greatest pleasure of all in writing is the pleasure that comes
to you yourself. To get real enjoyment from writing you should write on
a subject you know thoroughly or on one that interests you—preferably
both. Write without reserve; call things by their right names. Use care
in selecting the exact word to express your meaning. Write clearly,
concisely, and vividly. Be definite and particular rather than indefinite
and general. Use incidents freely to illustrate your points. Be forceful
and picturesque. Write so that anyone who knows you could pick your
written creation out of a thousand written by others on the same subject.

Write something you are proud of and you will get more pleasure from it
than from almost anything else you ever did. Even though you may not
yet have realized it, writing is a great deal more fun than going to
the theater, dancing, or watching a football game. The greatest thrill
in life comes from seeing one whom you love create something. The next
greatest comes from creating something yourself. Create something in
writing that truly represents you and you too will experience this joy.




CHAPTER II

HOW TO WRITE


The successive steps in writing are:

1. Have a subject that appeals to you, and write for an actual reader.

2. Gather all the material your subject demands.

3. Arrange your material in the most effective order.

4. Write as fast as you can.

5. Revise, recast, rewrite what you have written.

       *       *       *       *       *

1. Write on a subject which interests you and one that you know something
about. Good writing will not result merely from trying to satisfy an
instructor. You can write well only if you have a compelling reason for
writing; if you desire to convince, inform, or entertain a definite
reader.

Know the state of mind you want your reader to be in when he finishes
reading your composition. Write for a definite reader such as a college
freshman, a high school student, an automobile owner, a ten-year-old
boy, a proprietor of a retail store in a town of from 15,000 to 20,000
inhabitants. It will often be helpful if, after you choose the general
class to whom your writing is addressed, you select one individual you
know and keep him constantly in mind while you write. Thus instead of
writing for a ten-year-old boy write for your brother Robert.

Choose a subject that can be covered in the number of words at your
disposal. If you are writing a four-hundred-word theme, “The American
High School” is a poor subject. It would take a series of volumes to
exhaust the possibilities in that title. Even eliminating a large
portion of it by taking the topic “High School Newspapers,” “High School
Debating,” “High School Dramatics,” or “High School Athletics,” helps but
little. Narrowing any one of these subjects so that it applies only to
your own high school still leaves you with more material than can well be
put into a short theme. Good subjects for such themes are “The First Time
I Faced an Audience,” “The Best Play I Ever Made,” “How I Felt When My
Story Appeared in the School Paper,” and “The Most Exciting Play I Ever
Saw in a Baseball Game.”

To take another example, “Cooking” is a subject broad enough for a Mrs.
Ralston, a Mrs. Lincoln, or a Miss Farmer. “Making Desserts” is too
comprehensive for any but an exhaustive treatise. “Making Ice Cream”
requires at least a booklet. Good short theme subjects would be “How
I Make My Favorite Sherbet,” “How to Make Chocolate Ice Cream without
Cream,” or “How to Make Ice Cream Roll with a Frozen Whipped Cream
Center.”

       *       *       *       *       *

2. Reflect, read, ask questions, observe in order to gather material
which will enable you to carry out your design. Gather, as applied
to material for writing, implies a go-and-get-it attitude. Gathering
material requires a physical as well as a mental search. Do not expect
material to come to you; go after it. Talk with persons who know. Read
what they have written. Good writing is most likely to result when the
writer fuses his own experience and observation with the experience and
observation of others. Gather all the material possible without trying to
decide, while you are getting it, what is important and what is not. Keep
your mind, your eyes, and your ears wide open. Get details and get plenty
of them. Steep, saturate yourself in your subject.

       *       *       *       *       *

3. After you have gathered the material, discard everything that will
not help you to produce the effect you are trying for. Then if there are
any gaps in your composition, gather more material to fill them up. Some
writers get the best results by putting a plan on paper before starting
to write; others let a plan take more or less definite shape in their
minds, but do not try to set down any hard and fast outline. The reason
for not making a hard and fast outline is that a curious thing often
happens to any writer who has written much. He finds—on occasion—that
his composition seems to write itself. The characters he thought he had
created have minds of their own and refuse to let him treat them like
puppets. His thoughts seem to be alive and to exist apart from him. They
insist on expressing themselves in their own way. An experienced writer
does some of his best work when he seems to be merely the medium through
which ideas are seeking to translate themselves from whatever world it is
they inhabit to this one. If, on the other hand, a writer is continually
consulting a plan, his ideas and characters never take things into their
own hands.

Write for someone to read. Put yourself in that reader’s place and see if
your writing is producing the desired effect. Begin your composition with
the details that will most effectively attract his attention and arouse
his interest. Continue writing so that you will retain his attention and
interest. Stop when you have said all you have to say.

       *       *       *       *       *

4. Write rapidly and at white heat. If pertinent ideas keep coming to you
forget about your plan. Get your inspiration on paper before it cools. If
you finally find a system—or even a lack of one—that enables you to write
fast and at the same time to feel that you are creating something, do not
let anyone talk you into trying some other plan. Stick to your own.

       *       *       *       *       *

5. Revise at leisure, but ruthlessly, in cold blood, and continue to
revise, rearrange, and rewrite indefinitely until the finished product
satisfies you.

Make the final draft absolutely correct. Avoid especially the common
faults that denote the semi-illiterate man or woman. If you make errors
that would not be made by a twelve-year-old child, your composition will
get scant consideration from an intelligent reader. While revising,
question everything, spelling, grammar, choice of words, punctuation;
question the usefulness of each idea, and the arrangement of the parts of
the completed composition.

Start writing soon enough to give yourself ample time for revision. Let
the first draft get cold before you look at it again. If you wait several
days after the first draft is finished you can approach your own writing
as objectively as if it had been done by someone else. It will then be
much easier to question every letter, every word, every phrase, every
sentence, every paragraph, every idea, besides the whole composition and
each of its parts.

Make everything in your composition justify itself. Whenever you are
satisfied to do mediocre work the rest of the world is satisfied with
the valuation you have set on yourself. Be your own severest critic. Show
your own writing no mercy. Some of the world’s most successful writers of
advertisements as well as of novels have rewritten their best work time
and again before giving it to the public. What reads smoothly takes hours
of toil to produce.

Many good instructors insist on receiving two copies of every composition
from each student; one a rough, lead pencil draft, and the other the
finished manuscript.

CHAPTER IV

THE WHOLE COMPOSITION


“Whole composition” is the name given to a completed piece of writing.


PRELIMINARIES

Go out and gather the material.

Write the first draft as fast as you can.

Revise everything you have written until the following requirements have
been met.

=100. Indicate within the first few sentences what the composition is
about.=

Some of the more common devices used by experienced writers in beginning
a composition are listed below. You can begin almost anything you will be
called upon to write in one of these ways or in a combination of two or
more of them. Use a different beginning for each composition you write
until you have tried a considerable number of them. After some practice
you can quickly select the one beginning that is most appropriate both to
your material and to your reader.

   1. Make one or more startling assertions.
   2. Ask one or more questions.
   3. Say something clever.
   4. Make one or more suppositions.
   5. Contrast one thing with another.
   6. Use direct discourse.
   7. Use an incident.
   8. Sketch in the background.
   9. Introduce one of the characters.
  10. Employ a preliminary summary.
  11. Plunge your reader into suspense.
  12. State the conclusion the reader is to reach.
  13. Give personal details about yourself.
  14. Talk about your reader.
  15. State your reflections on the subject.
  16. Explain why you are writing.
  17. Invoke aid in accomplishing your purpose.
  18. Quote a familiar saying.
  19. Parody a familiar saying.
  20. Quote what someone has said or written.
  21. Quote what purports to be what someone has said or written.

=101. Keep the same point of view throughout.=

  _Wrong._ If one wishes to enter a canoe safely, he should grasp
    both gunwales and lower himself to the seat. You should then
    push off from the shore.

  _Better._ To enter a canoe safely, grasp both gunwales and
    lower yourself to the seat before pushing off from the shore.

  _Wrong._ As he stood looking down the river he saw a house-boat
    plowing along; while behind him a fleet of coal barges sent
    ripples toward the shore.

  _Better._ As he stood looking down the river he saw a
    house-boat plowing along. Turning around he noticed a fleet of
    coal barges sending ripples toward the shore.

  _Wrong._ The taxi driver has an excellent opportunity to
    observe the life about him. All kinds and conditions of men and
    women make use of him at all hours of the day and night. Some
    think him merely a part of the machine he drives, some consider
    him no better than the dirt under their feet, and some—to
    be sure they are not many—treat him as if he were a living,
    breathing human being like themselves.

  _Better._ The taxi driver has an excellent opportunity to
    observe the life about him. All kinds and conditions of men and
    women make use of him at all hours during the day and night. He
    finds that some treat him as if he were no better than the dirt
    under their feet, and some—to be sure they are not many—as if
    he were a living, breathing human being like themselves.

=102. Include everything that the reader will need for a thorough
understanding of your subject.=

  _Wrong._

                     THE THEATER IN AMERICA

    Between the years 1750 and 1814 many events took place which
    either helped or hindered the establishment of a permanent
    theater in America.

    One of the big events that helped establish the theater in
    America was the coming of the Hallam company of actors. This
    company was made up of English actors who came from the West
    Indies. The company consisted of twelve adult members and three
    children. Every member of the group had ability as an actor,
    and, consequently, the company was successful. They first
    played at Yorktown, Virginia, in 1752. Then, after a season in
    Philadelphia, they went to New York. After a three months’ stay
    in New York, they returned to the West Indies, where Mr. Hallam
    died. Here a Mr. Douglas reorganized the company and with them
    returned to this country.

    Douglas, often called the “theater builder,” did much for the
    future theater. He was a man of great strength and courage.
    Besides being a capable manager, he was also a good actor.
    Douglas built the first theater in America at Williamsburg,
    Virginia, and the first permanent theater at Philadelphia. He
    also built theaters at Annapolis and at Newport.

    The greatest difficulty which the play companies had to
    overcome was the increasing opposition of some of the people
    toward the theater. Throughout the country people were
    fighting against the theater. Especially was this true of
    the people of the North. The Southerners were fun-loving and
    pleasure-seeking, and the theater offered them a place of
    amusement. In many towns, however, laws were passed against
    acting. The opposition of the people was not directed so
    much toward the theater itself as toward the gambling and
    immorality which accompanied the theater of that day. Folders
    were distributed among the people explaining why the theater
    was not approved of and gradually the gambling and immorality
    disappeared. After this the theater improved and theater-going
    became better thought of throughout the country.

  _Better._

             AN EARLY INFLUENCE IN THE AMERICAN THEATER

    In the year 1752 the theater in America received a great aid
    through the coming of the Hallam company of actors....

    The condition of the theater prior to this time left much to be
    desired....

    The nature of the company was such that its influence was
    decidedly good....

    Naturally the effect of this kind of player was toward the
    betterment of the theater....

=103. Omit anything that will distract the reader’s attention.=

  _Wrong._

                      SCORING IN BASKETBALL

    A score in basketball is made every time a player throws
    the ball into one of the baskets placed at each end of the
    court. In the West Branch High School the gymnasium is well
    equipped with everything the students need for their athletic
    contests....

  _Better._ A score is made in basketball every time a player
    succeeds in throwing the ball into the basket guarded by his
    opponents. If this goal, as it is called, is made from the
    field, it counts two points. Sometimes, however, one team is
    given a free throw at the basket as the result of a foul’s
    being made. If the ball is caged under this circumstance, the
    foul goal, as it is called, counts one point.

=104. Writing that is serious in tone or purpose should include nothing
that will destroy its seriousness.=

  _Wrong._ Gypsies are a peculiar, wandering race of people
    that appeared in eastern Europe in the fourteenth century
    and that has now spread out into Asia, America, and parts of
    Africa. These people are easily distinguished from those among
    whom they rove by appearance, by language, and by behavior.
    In appearance they are slight, though very strong; in color,
    somewhat tawny. In language they are thought to resemble some
    long-lost Hindu tribe. In behavior they are _sneaky_, and a
    number of them are not above _chicken stealing_.

  _Better._ Gypsies are a peculiar, wandering race of people....
    In behavior they are _untrustworthy_, and a number of them are
    not above _petty thievery_.

=105. Writing that is light in tone or purpose should include nothing
that will destroy its lightness.=

  _Wrong._ Many different types are in evidence around
    Fitzgerald’s boathouse in the spring. The type most frequently
    discovered, perhaps, is the lover. He comes, accompanied by
    his inamorata, in quest of a canoe, in which presently the two
    are drifting idly upon the ample bosom of Turtle creek. It is
    strange that lovers should sojourn here, for Turtle creek is
    anything rather than a background for romance.

  _Better._ Many different types are in evidence around
    Fitzgerald’s boathouse in spring.... Muddy water, sand dredges,
    a railway construction gang at work near at hand, the whole
    background is unheeded by the lovers—romance needs no setting.

=106. Arrange your ideas in some orderly sequence.=

Following are various kinds of sequence.

=107. Arrange ideas in chronological order.=

    All day long we were happy as a wedding party.... Early in the
    morning.... When noon came.... At night....

=108. Arrange the divisions of the composition according to the relative
position of the objects treated.=

    As we entered the garden.... On the right.... On the left....
    Directly before us.... Upon going into the house....

=109. Work from the abstract to the concrete.=

    Freedom may be defined as the state of being free, but to how
    many of us is this actually illuminating? Let us take, for
    example, a man who has just been released from prison, where he
    has been closely guarded for more than ten years. What would be
    his idea of freedom?

=110. Work from summary to detail.=

    When once the mania for news gathering claims its victim,
    everything he sees becomes potential news.

    He looks for it on his way down town in the morning....

    The restaurant at which he lunches is combed unconsciously for
    items....

    In the lobby of hotels and theaters....

    Even his relatives and close friends become his prey....

=111. Work from what is of most importance to what is less so.=

    Mohammed VI, the Turkish sultan, fled from Constantinople on a
    British warship, bound for Malta, today. The sultan declared
    he was not abdicating, but was merely removing himself from
    immediate danger. He was accompanied by....

=112. Work from the familiar to the unfamiliar.=

    Everybody has noticed the way a cat’s claws are incased in
    tiny sheaths, but how many of us know why they should be?
    In the first place, the cat is descended from a wild animal
    whose way of obtaining food was to kill its prey and then
    tear it to pieces. Naturally when this animal struck into the
    dead body with its claws, the claws, being hook-like, would
    tend to remain fast. But nature found a way of overcoming the
    difficulty by incasing the claws in sheaths so that while
    the paw of the animal is still inside the carcass, the claw
    can be withdrawn into the sheath and the paw removed without
    hindrance. Perfection in nature extends even to such trifles as
    this.

=113. Work up to a climax.=

    Now, as always before, it is the custom to give way to great
    manifestations of joy when the football team wins over a
    university that is much older and much better established. Just
    as soon as the report comes in that Drake is gaining, feeling
    begins to run high; when it is said that Drake is ahead, we
    begin to hold our breath; but when the report spreads that
    Drake has won, excitement breaks out like a vast tidal wave and
    sweeps everything before it.

=114. Weld paragraph to paragraph so that they will obviously be parts of
the whole instead of separate units.=

Following are various methods of accomplishing this welding:

=115. Weld paragraph to paragraph by word connectives.=

    On a summer evening the shores of Lake Tiberias are thronged
    with strange and interesting people.

    Here are caravans from across the Arabian desert....

    Above them a Bedouin drives his flocks....

    Not far away a rich Arabian farmer....

    Around him, around everyone, in fact, little Arabian boys....

    Then, as the last rays of the sun disappear behind the Mountain
    of Beatitudes, ...

=116. Weld paragraph to paragraph by repetition.=

    ... Thus it is that I came to believe in ghosts.

    But ghosts are not all that I came to believe in that summer....

=117. Weld paragraph to paragraph by recapitulation.=

    ... Guns, horses, motors, men, all thundered along the road,
    then, like dogs of war let loose at Armageddon.

    The hunt was up; the scent was on the air—Germany was
    unchained....

=118. Weld paragraph to paragraph by announcing the divisions.=

    The most attractive flower to me among all those that grow in
    my garden is the sweet pea, chiefly, I think, because of the
    delicacy of its color, form, and fragrance.

=119. Give each idea the space it deserves.=

  _Wrong._ As the sun climbed higher, the spell of the dawn was
    broken, and the camp came to life. Soon the surface of the lake
    was dotted with bobbing heads. Upon the crests of the low hills
    farmers were seen beginning to plow. Milk carts rattled along
    the roads toward the creamery. All was in harmony to foretell a
    perfect day.

  _Better._ As the sun climbed higher, the spell of the dawn was
    broken, and the camp began to come to life. Soon the surface
    of the lake was dotted with bobbing heads as the campers
    splashed about taking their dip before breakfast. There was
    much laughter and merry shouting; everybody was ready to have
    as much fun as he could. Across the lake the farmers were
    commencing to plow. And from the road behind came the rattle of
    milk carts on their way to the creamery. It was morning; the
    world was awake.

=120. Give each idea the position it deserves.=

  _Wrong._ Here and there the long, shiny body of a fish shot
    out of the water and fell back with a faint splash. The lake
    changed from the deep blue reflected from the clear sky to all
    the brilliant colors of the sunset. The sun began to set long
    before it should have, according to the campers’ ideas. Canoes
    crept out without a sound from the shore, and the campers
    enjoyed to the fullest their favorite time of the day. Gulls
    called back and forth and settled for the night on jutting sand
    bars.

  _Better._ The sun began to set long before it should have,
    according to the campers’ ideas. The lake changed in color
    from the deep blue that had been reflected from the clear sky
    to all the brilliance of the sunset. Here and there the long,
    shiny body of a fish shot out of the water and fell back with a
    gentle splash. Gulls called back and forth to one another and
    began to settle for the night on jutting sand bars. Now canoes
    crept from the shore without a sound, and the campers enjoyed
    to the full this their favorite hour of the day.

=121. End with whatever will give an impression of a well-rounded whole.=

    ... With all these hints of prospective fun, how easy it is to
    bang the books back upon the table and let the world go hang—on
    Friday night.

=122. Choose a title that will indicate in a word or a phrase what the
composition is about. Be sure not to refer to the title in the body of
the composition as if it were an integral part of the composition.=

  _Wrong._

                          FRIDAY NIGHT

    This is the night of all the week to which I looked forward
    with the most pleasure.

  _Better._

                   THE BEST NIGHT IN THE WEEK

    There is one night in the week that is, to me, more pleasant
    than any other. You know which one it is as well as I do, for
    it is your best friend, too.

=123. Plan long compositions as you gather the material.=

Use cards or slips of paper of uniform size for making notes while
reading. During the early stages of your reading, the various topics
which you will discuss will begin to make their appearance. Make only one
note on each card. After writing the note, write one or two words in the
upper left-hand corner to indicate the topic treated in that note. As you
accumulate notes, keep them sorted according to the topics.

When all the available sources of material have been utilized and all
the notes taken, arrange the various stacks—one stack for each topic—by
first spreading them out upon a table so that you can see readily all
the topics at once. Then move the stacks about, thus trying out various
arrangements until you have made one which seems logical and complete.
You will then have a plan for your composition.

=124. Revise for arrangement and development by making a plan of the
composition after it is finished.=

By outlining the composition you have written, you will be able to see
just how certain ideas bear upon the subject and are related to one
another. Again, the outline will show you whether or not the ideas
follow any orderly sequence. But best of all, perhaps, it will enable
you to judge whether the composition omits anything that is vital for
complete understanding, or contains something that distracts the reader’s
attention.

Following is a method for making a plan of the composition:

    STROKES MOST COMMONLY USED IN TENNIS

    Idea to be developed: In order to be a good tennis player one
    must master certain strokes.

    I. The service stroke
       A. Position of body
            1. Poised so that weight be added to stroke
               a. Leans away from toss
               b. Follows racket in striking
       B. Tossing ball
            1. Ball at arm’s length from shoulder
            2. Held somewhat before body
            3. Thrown lightly three or four feet in air
       C. Striking ball
            1. Racket raised to strike as ball descends
            2. Force necessary
            3. Accuracy necessary
               a. Ball must strike court within bounds
                   I´. Dimensions of receiver’s court.

    Etc.

=125. Exercise.=

Following is a composition that is very poorly put together.

1. Make an outline of the whole, using only the topic sentence in each
paragraph.

2. Strike out any topic which does not help to express the central idea.
Reword any topic which can be made to serve its purpose better. Add any
other topics which will aid in developing more fully the central idea.
Combine topics that explain almost the same thing.

3. Make changes in the arrangement of topics so that each topic will
stand in its proper relationship to every other.

4. Make an outline of every paragraph, using every sentence.

5. Shift sentences into positions where they will serve better to develop
the topic. Strike out any that do not directly apply. Reword any that
can be improved by rewording. Insert additional sentences where they are
needed.

6. Shift sentences from one paragraph to another if they can thus be made
to serve their purpose better.

7. Copy the material in the regulation form for a composition, taking
care that there is proper transition from sentence to sentence, and from
paragraph to paragraph.

8. Apply these admonitions to one of your own compositions and rewrite
accordingly.

                        WHY TAKE BOXING?

    Boxing is a very interesting sport. When the child of
    kindergarten age first attends school he has his first
    experience with fighting. This happens at every meeting of boys
    and continues into the teens. Nearly every real American boy
    wants to learn how to protect himself, and a course in boxing
    is the best way to learn defense. In boxing, the individual
    learns where the best blows are planted and also how to ward
    off these blows. If a boy knows these punches he will not be
    imposed upon by his companions. Even in later life men often
    become quarrelsome and come to blows, but the man who has
    learned the fundamentals of boxing always comes out in the
    lead. If every man knew how to box, robberies would be less
    frequent because the victims would be less timid and would give
    battle to the bandits instead of allowing themselves to be held
    up by highwaymen. Thus, defense is an important element in
    boxing.

    Moreover, boxing, besides aiding in defense, is a healthful
    sport. The body is developed greatly after one goes out for
    boxing as is shown by the increase or decrease in weight,
    as the case may be. The weight decreases if one has been
    in the habit of taking no exercise as he begins training,
    but the weight soon increases again as the body makes the
    proper readjustments. Persons who are fleshy soon lose their
    superfluous fat. With the adjustment of weight the muscles
    are developed. The arms and shoulders with their continuous
    exercise in delivering punches and warding off blows are highly
    developed. The muscles of the body are developed to a great
    extent by the continuous twisting and bending of the body. The
    legs become firmer and carry the body with ease after practice
    in boxing because of the rapid forward, backward, and side
    movements necessary.

    Again, the body is developed in quickness by the practice of
    boxing. The boxer’s mind is made more alert by the habitual
    practice. The muscles of the body also increase in quickness.
    They respond instantly to the will of the mind and thereby
    increase the ability to advance and retreat rapidly, to
    deliver and ward off punches. When the boxer has developed
    this quickness of sensory and muscular organs, he can grasp
    the intent of his opponent’s actions more quickly and govern
    himself accordingly.

    Boxing is a very well-known sport. It is widely popular both
    in Europe and in America. It originated several centuries ago.
    The main reason for the popularity of boxing is that it is a
    very interesting sport. The spectator is held by the rapid
    action of the boxers. In the early days of boxing the men were
    slow and relied chiefly upon strength, but the modern boxer
    has developed speed and uses short, quick blows. If the boxer
    of the past should fight the boxer of the present, the affair
    would be very one-sided, because the latter would soon tire out
    his opponent by his quickness.

    Besides being interesting because of the violent action that
    is a natural part of the sport, it is also interesting from
    the point of view of the money-maker. Thousands of dollars
    are spent every year in developing winners. This was shown in
    our latest match, the Dempsey-Carpentier fight, in which many
    thousands of dollars were involved. An international spirit
    also prevails when boxers from two countries meet. This was
    indicated in the same match when all the Americans yelled for
    Jack and all the foreigners for Georges.

    Boxing has grown in popularity through the ages because of its
    aid to health and because of its interesting features.




CHAPTER V

THE PARAGRAPH


A paragraph is an indented division of the whole composition. Beginning
with an indention, and usually ending with a partly blank last line,
it constitutes a visible block of material on the page. The successive
blocks relieve the strain on the reader and enable him to mark each step
in the advance from division to division of the thought. In length the
paragraph ordinarily ranges from 150 to 300 words.

=200. Indent the first word of each paragraph at least half an inch. In
typing, indent five spaces. Every paragraph begins on a new line.=

=201. The last sentence in the paragraph sometimes ends before the
right-hand margin of the page is reached. In this case the last line of
the paragraph may be left partly blank. All other lines must be filled
clear to the margin.=

=202. Do not indent every sentence as if it were a new paragraph.=

  _Wrong._ At that time they reorganized a girls’ basketball
    team which had been dropped two years before, and they made me
    jumping center.

    Although our high school was not a large one, we played some
    very good games, and managed to make a good record for the four
    years.

    In my last year we had a new superintendent who was interested
    in athletics, and we then had teams in basketball, football,
    baseball, and track.

  _Right._ At that time they reorganized a girls’ basketball
    team which had been dropped two years before, and they made
    me jumping center. Although our high school was not a large
    one, we played some very good games, and managed to make a
    good record for the four years. In my last year we had a new
    superintendent who was interested in athletics, and we then had
    teams in basketball, football, baseball, and track.

=203. In representing conversation, begin a new paragraph with every
change of speaker.=

  _Wrong._ “Shall we go swimming after school tonight?” I asked.
    “No, I have to work,” John replied. “When can we go, then?”
    “Tomorrow night after school, or any time Saturday. I don’t
    have to work next Saturday at all.” “All right; let’s go
    tomorrow.”

  _Right._ “Shall we go swimming after school tonight?” I asked.

    “No, I have to work,” John replied.

    “When can we go, then?”

    “Tomorrow night after school, or any time Saturday. I don’t
    have to work next Saturday at all.”

    “All right; let’s go tomorrow.”

=204. Form one paragraph out of two short paragraphs which actually
constitute one division of the whole composition.=

  _Wrong._ He always has a smile and a kind word for everyone.
    He tries to lift everyone with whom he comes in contact to a
    higher plane of living.

    Much sorrow has come into his life, but it seems to have made
    him only kinder and more gentle.

  _Better._ He always has a smile and a kind word for everyone.
    He tries to lift everyone with whom he comes in contact to a
    higher plane of living. Much sorrow has come into his life,
    but it seems to have made him only kinder and more gentle.

=205. Break up a paragraph that is too long into two or more paragraphs.
The subject matter of each of the new paragraphs thus formed should
constitute a natural subdivision of what was originally one paragraph.=

  _Tedious._ Just like all children, Charlotte was not perfect,
    either in school or out. While she was in the second grade,
    she was sent home for making paper boats during study time,
    a fascinating pastime which the teacher did not approve of;
    and while she was in the fourth grade, she and a friend were
    sent to the superintendent for a lecture because out of
    curiosity they looked through the window of the school room
    one evening after closing time to watch a naughty schoolmate
    get his paddling. The grammar school days arrived at last,
    and with them came the habit of giggling and playing, at the
    expense of lessons and the trying of the teacher’s patience
    and temper. During the first year in high school she calmed
    down and worked hard to establish a reputation. She was always
    very enthusiastic over athletics and yelled herself hoarse at
    basketball or football games. A great deal of her time was
    spent in reading books of various types and in out-of-doors
    sports. While she was a junior and also during the last year
    of her high school career, she helped her father with the book
    work in his office, thus getting a little experience along
    that line and also earning for herself some expense money.
    Commencement finally came, and she was graduated in a class of
    thirty-three with all the thrills and excitement which usually
    accompany that occasion.

  _Better._ Just like all children, Charlotte was not perfect,
    either in school or out. While she was in the second grade,
    for instance, she was once sent home for making paper boats, a
    fascinating pastime for her, but one, however, of which the
    teacher did not approve, especially during study hours. Again,
    when she was in the fourth grade, one evening after school had
    closed for the day she and a friend peeped through the school
    room window out of curiosity to see a naughty schoolmate get
    his paddling. The result was a lecture from the superintendent
    the next day.

    Grammar school days arrived at last, and with them came the
    habit of giggling and playing, at the expense of lessons and
    of trying the teacher’s patience and temper. During her first
    year in high school, however, she calmed down and worked hard
    to establish a reputation. She was very enthusiastic over
    athletics and frequently yelled herself hoarse at basketball
    or football games. Much of her time at this period of her life
    was spent in reading books of various types and in out-of-door
    sports.

    Nevertheless, while she was a junior and also during her senior
    year, she found time to help her father with the book work in
    his office, and so acquired a little business experience and
    also earned some expense money. And finally, when commencement
    came, she was graduated along with thirty-three others amid
    all the thrills and excitement that usually accompany this
    memorable occasion.

=206. Avoid a violent break in thought within the paragraph.=

  _Wrong._ At the age of five I entered the public school. The
    second day in school began the happiest days of my life with
    a good whipping. This whipping brought into my life the best
    friend I ever had. After eight years of the closest friendship
    he passed out of my life. It was then that the realization of
    what a mother could be swept over me. Until this time my mother
    had been a person to go to when in trouble. She now appeared to
    me in the new light of a pal.

  _Better._ At the age of five I entered the public school. A
    good whipping, which I received my second day in school,
    not only ushered in the happiest days of my life, but also
    brought me one of the best friends I have ever had, Mr. Clark,
    the superintendent. During my eight years in that school he
    remained my closest friend, and it was not until I had finished
    there and Mr. Clark had passed out of my life that I began to
    realize what a real friend my mother could be.

    Until this time my mother had been only a person to whom I
    could go when I was in trouble; now she appeared more like a
    pal.

=207. Discard any material that does not belong in the paragraph.=

  _Wrong._ When evening comes and his day’s work is completed, he
    hurries home to his family. He is not extravagant in his home,
    but has it neatly furnished. If the weather is favorable, he
    takes them all for a drive in the country, or they go visiting,
    or do something else which he arranges for the pleasure of
    those he loves.

    he hurries home to his family. If the weather is favorable, he
    takes them all for a drive in the country, or they go visiting,
    or do something else which he arranges for the pleasure of
    those he loves.

=208. The substance of a good paragraph can usually be summed up in a
single sentence. It is often advantageous to put such a sentence, called
a topic sentence, at or near the beginning of the paragraph.=

  _Example._ _Of all the places for summer dreams the best is a
    California beach._ There the blended sights and sounds form a
    quiet setting for fanciful thoughts. The old Pacific rolls in
    its oily swells with only a rippling murmur; the droning roar
    of the surf a half mile down the shoreline rises from the tug
    of waves on tons of pebbles; the white hull of a launch is
    dipping, dipping far out upon the water, its regular exhausts
    sounding faint and thin. These sights and sounds are dreamy and
    far off; under the mood of them the quiet mind builds sweet,
    lazy air castles, to be forgotten and renewed.

=209. Arrange ideas in some definite order within the paragraph. (See
106-113.)=

  _Example._ A fence has been the evil genius of my life. It
    was not a remarkable fence, either; just a neat picket fence
    painted white. It surrounded a beautiful, well-kept lawn and
    guarded an old, pretty house which overflowed with books and
    toys. But the toys would sometimes become tiresome, and I
    would look wistfully through the fence at the children playing
    across the street. I would have liked to join them or to have
    them come over—but there stood the fence. I learned to read
    and gradually built up a play world of my own until one day I
    realized that I liked the fence. I no longer cared to play with
    the other children, and when I went to school I found that I
    could not play with them. The fence had followed me. The years
    outside the fence have changed me somewhat, but still whenever
    I am in a group of young people I have a feeling that I am not
    one of them. I want to stand back and watch them play. Some
    people call my backwardness shyness or timidity, others call it
    pouting and attribute it to a disagreeable disposition, but I
    know what it is: it is a neat picket fence painted white.

=210. Link sentence to sentence within the paragraph by using words
and phrases of reference, such as _he_, _this_, _then_, _however_, _of
course_.=

  _Example._ There is a delicacy about sweet peas that makes
    them more attractive to me than any other flower in my garden.
    Notice the way the blossom is joined to the stem. _It_ is
    poised there with such nice balance that at the least puff of
    air the flower sways on its long green stalk with the rhythm
    of the wind. _And_, _too_, their delicacy of color is beyond
    that of most flowers. Really, the only thing I can think of
    to compare with them is the clouds at sunrise. If you have
    noticed, the colors _then_ are fresh and vivid from the light
    behind the clouds, though a faint mist makes them more elusive
    than the colors of broad day. In the sweet peas the _same_
    airy, translucent color is repeated—the wan white, the sober
    purple blending into lavender, the rose in infinite variety.
    And there are other things, _besides_—the dewy freshness
    that clings to them all day, the coolness of them, the faint
    perfume—which make me think them different from the rest of
    the flowers in my garden and which set them apart from all the
    others in delicacy.

=211. Link sentence to sentence within the paragraph by causing each to
grow out of the one preceding.=

  _Example._ A university is an institution of higher learning.
    For purposes of ministering the better to the various demands
    made upon it, it is made up of a number of colleges, as the
    college of medicine, the college of law, that of engineering,
    of liberal arts, of commerce, for instance, each college being
    in charge of an officer called the dean. The colleges, in turn,
    are composed of various departments, such as the department
    of Romance languages, of art, and of home economics; these
    are under the charge of officers called department heads or
    professors. And finally, each department presents many courses
    of instruction, like French, rhetoric, European history, and
    architectural drawing, each course being taught directly by
    an officer called an instructor or professor. Hence, although
    from the variety of its interests and the complexity of its
    activities it would seem that a university is an awkward,
    ungainly organism, nevertheless, if one examines it closely,
    one finds that it is a highly organized and smoothly running
    machine.

=212. Avoid an inconsistent change in number within the paragraph.=

  _Wrong._ Here we find what amusements occupy his or her time.
    This is where their chief characteristics can be pointed out.
    Then a word here, an oddly written phrase there, or a lack of
    words gives us a clue to the nature of the student.

  _Better._ Here we find what amusements occupy his time. This is
    where his chief characteristics can be pointed out. Then a word
    here, an oddly written phrase there, or a lack of words gives
    us a clue to the nature of the student.

=213. Avoid an inconsistent change in person within the paragraph.=

  _Wrong._ One learns to like some students, of whom there are
    too few upon the campus. Others I dislike, and of these there
    are too many.

  _Better._ One learns to like some students, of whom there are
    too few upon the campus. Others one dislikes, and of these
    there are too many.

=214. Avoid an inconsistent change in tense within the paragraph.=

  _Wrong._ My flower garden in June is a most interesting and
    beautiful sight. On a bright sunny morning one would stop in
    amazement; the flowers were so happy when the sun reached their
    faces, still wet with dew, that they fairly sparkled.

    and beautiful sight. On a bright sunny morning one stops in
    amazement; the flowers are so happy when the sun reaches their
    faces, still wet with dew, that they fairly sparkle.

=215. Avoid an inconsistent change in voice within the paragraph.=

  _Wrong._ His directions were brief and to the point. Every
    question I asked was answered by just the information I
    desired—no more, no less. When dictating he used only the
    simplest words. All inquiries in letters were answered plainly.

    and always answered plainly all inquiries in letters.

=216. Avoid an inconsistent change in mood within the paragraph.=

  _Wrong._ If you were to visit the library on Saturday
    afternoon, you would find it nearly deserted. The tables would
    be empty and the reading room very quiet. The students are upon
    the river or are enjoying themselves upon the campus. Someone,
    however, who has a paper to get in may be busy at the reference
    shelves.

  _Better._ If you were to visit the library on Saturday

    be empty and the reading room very quiet. The students would
    be upon the river or enjoying themselves about the campus.
    Someone, however, who had a paper to get in might be busy at
    the reference shelves.

=217. Put the most significant idea near the beginning or the end of the
paragraph.=

  _Example._ Far as he could see through the gathering dark
    there was quiet, the reaction after tremendous exertion.
    Shapes of men surrounded him. Here lay one flat upon his back,
    his features sketched in sharp focus by the fading light.
    Three yards to one side sat two bodies leaning back to back,
    heads upon breasts, helmets over eyes. Beyond them huddled an
    indistinguishable mass. On the other side, so close he could
    have touched them, an arm and a leg strung along in a line—no
    torso within a rod of them. The world lay desolate and silent
    except for the yellowing moon and the far off, intermittent
    firing.

  _Example._ My one worry and regret, however, was the fact
    that my father was the president of the school board. Part
    of my teachers gave me good grades because they were afraid
    they would lose their positions if they did otherwise, and
    the rest of them tried to flunk me because they thought they
    were not being paid highly enough. Among them all I managed to
    make about a B average, and the problem which now remains for
    the university to solve is, did I receive more or less than I
    deserved while in high school.

=218. Give most space to the most significant idea.=

  _Example._ Since man’s progress through the ages is a passage
    from the undeveloped to the highly developed, one wonders what
    the buildings of a thousand years from now will be like. From
    that day in the remote past, when the first cliff dweller
    conceived the idea of enlarging his home by carving out another
    terrace in the rock above it, to this day when we have a
    skyscraper 750 feet high, man’s building has approached nearer
    and nearer to the clouds. As the little two-story terrace
    grew, the cliff dwellers wondered and doubted. Likewise,
    when a four-story building was a fact accomplished by our
    great-grandfathers, to live in a ten-story building would have
    been considered extremely hazardous. And now since we have the
    forty-story Singer building, will man continue to aspire to the
    clouds or will he remain satisfied with his achievement?

=219. Practice.=

Here is a paragraph that is very poorly put together. On the basis of
what you have just studied, answer the following questions and rewrite
the paragraph accordingly.

1. What about the indention?

2. What about the right-hand margin?

3. Should the speech of the mother be given a whole paragraph?

4. Is it possible to form more than one good paragraph of this thought?
Why, or why not?

5. Does a break occur in the thought? Where?

6. Should anything be discarded? What?

7. Can you find a topic sentence, or must you compose one?

8. What about the arrangement of ideas?

9. Can you improve the links between sentences? How?

10. Can you give more prominence to significant ideas? How?

    Perhaps it was from her father that she got her restlessness.
    Accidentally she put her finger on the label of what looked
    to be the top of an ordinary hat, and the flat shape she held
    immediately took the form of a hat. Her only ideas regarding
    him came through an incident that happened when she was about
    fourteen.

    She had never seen him, and her mother never mentioned his
    name. Her father lived in her mind as an ideal. She rushed,
    filled with questions, to her mother, for as long as she could
    remember there had never been a man in the house, and she
    had never seen such a hat except in pictures. Her mother was
    anything but romantic. She and her mother had been giving their
    house its fall cleaning, and she had found, wrapped up in an
    old silk comforter, what she took to be a hat—it was shaped
    like one except that it had no crown. “Your father’s,” had been
    the mother’s laconic answer, her lips drawing into a hard,
    straight line that forbade further questioning.




CHAPTER VI

GRAMMAR


In this short discussion of grammar the attempt is not made to discuss
exhaustively all the features of English grammar. The purpose is only
to survey and to identify all the elements of an ordinary sentence. The
definitions are few, and are descriptions rather than formal definitions.
The parts of speech are treated as they become important in the structure
of the sentence. Such a treatment of essentials as this is necessary
partly as a review, but especially because a teacher and a student
cannot discuss many of the commonest sentence faults unless they have a
mutually intelligible terminology. A student must be able to recognize
such grammatical elements as a subject or an object, a participle or
an infinitive, a phrase or a clause, in order to produce correct and
effective sentences. There is a minimum amount of grammatical knowledge
without which a writer cannot rewrite his compositions so as to avoid the
commonest errors and imperfections.


What Grammar Is

Grammar is the study of the structure of sentences, and of the forms and
functions of words and word-groups within sentences. In simple terms,
grammar is the examination of the machinery of language.


Sentences

Sentences make assertions (declarative sentences), or ask questions
(interrogative sentences), or give commands (imperative sentences), or
express emotion (exclamatory sentences). Written sentences begin with a
capital letter and end with a period, a question mark, or an exclamation
point.

The most common kind of written sentence is that which makes an
assertion. This kind, called declarative, may well be taken, therefore,
as the most available basis for the discussion of the machinery of the
sentence. The word sentence in this chapter will accordingly mean a
declarative sentence.


The Parts of a Sentence—Subject and Predicate

A sentence has at least two parts—a subject and a predicate.

The _subject_ is that part which designates what the assertion is about.

The _predicate_ is that part which makes the assertion.

Many students earn their way through college.

It is obvious that _Many students_ designates what the assertion is
about, and is therefore the subject. _Earn their way through college_
makes the assertion about _Many students_, and is, therefore, the
predicate.

Although the sentence may contain other elements, although the subject
or the predicate or both may be long and complicated, and although
the elements making up the subject and the predicate may be variously
arranged, nevertheless every normal declarative sentence contains these
two parts, and can be divided into these two parts.


Subjects

The fundamental word or element in the subject is a noun, a pronoun, a
gerund, an infinitive, or a clause.

A _noun_ is simply a name word. It may signify a person or an animate
being (Frank, boy, dog), an object (tree, box), a color (red), an action
(walking, step, discussion), a quality (goodness), an abstract idea
(truth, space), a general idea (speed, thing), to name only a few kinds
of nouns. But it is always the name of an individual or of a class of
persons or things.

A _pronoun_ is a substitute or symbol word which signifies a noun which
is either expressed near the pronoun or implied by the circumstances (he,
it, who, anyone, I, you).

A _gerund_ is a noun made by adding the suffix -ing to a verb (walking,
hoping, sitting, being).

An _infinitive_ is a form of a verb, usually preceded by the word _to_,
often used to name the action signified by the verb (to think, to have
gone).

A _clause_ is a sentence element consisting of a subject (in the
nominative case) and a predicate (with the verb in a finite form—that is,
not an infinitive or a participle).

    1. _Noun_:       Time flies.
    2. _Pronoun_:    He arrived late. Everybody was late. I can do it.
    3. _Gerund_:     Standing on the corner made him cold.
    4. _Infinitive_: To tell the truth was easy.
    5. _Clause_:     That he hath wronged me doth appear in this. Where
                       he stood makes no difference.


Predicates

The fundamental word in the predicate is the verb.

A _verb_ is a word—or a word-group—the function of which is to assert
something about the subject.

    The tide rises.

    The sun shone.

    I bought a book.

    The box is small.

The verb may consist of one word—as in the examples given—or it may
consist of a group of words, called a verb-group, containing sometimes as
many as five words. This verb group consists of one, two, three, or four
auxiliary verbs, followed by a form of the verb expressing the meaning or
sense. The form of the sense-verb is an infinitive, a present participle,
or a past participle.

    The moon will rise.

    The moon is rising.

    The moon has risen.

    He may light the lamp.

    He is going to light the lamp.

    The lamp at last was lighted.

    The lamp has been lighted.

    The lamp may have been lighted.

    He may have been going to light the lamp.


Structural Parts of the Predicate—Objects

_Intransitive verbs_ are those which, like _rise_, make assertions the
action of which does not involve any person or thing other than the
subject.

_Transitive verbs_ are those which, like _light_, make assertions which
involve some person or thing other than the subject in the action of the
verb. In the sentence _He lighted the lamp_, _lamp_ is such an _object_.

The same verb may sometimes assert one, and sometimes the other kind of
action.

    The door opened.

    He opened the door.

Some transitive verbs make an assertion which involves two nouns, both
signifying the same thing or person.

    The club elected Frank president.

Some transitive verbs make an assertion which involves two different
objects or persons.

    I gave Frank an apple.

    She bought Frank an apple.

    I told him a story.

Here _apple_ or _story_ is the object directly affected by the action of
the verb, and is, therefore, called the _direct object_. _Frank_ or _him_
designates the person for whose benefit the action of the verb affects
the direct object, and is called the _indirect object_.


Copulas and Complements

Still another kind of verb, called a _copula_, though it does not take
a direct object, makes only part of the assertion. The rest is made by
means of another word (or element) which characterizes the subject but
which is an essential part of the assertion. In fact, the _complement_,
as the element completing the verb is called, is the most significant
part of the predicate; the verb is merely a bit of machinery by means of
which the complement is turned into an assertion.

    The sky is red.

    The dark shape was a house.

    The car looks cheap.

    He is in the house.

    Home is where the heart is.

In these sentences, _red_, _a house_, _cheap_, _in the house_, and _where
the heart is_, are parts of the predicate, though they characterize the
subject. Such elements are called _complements_ because they complete
the assertion of the verb; if adjectives, they are called _adjective
complements_, or better, _predicated adjectives_; if nouns, they are
called _noun complements_, or _predicated nouns_; if clauses or phrases,
they are called _complements_, or _predicated phrases_ or _clauses_.
The verbs by means of which these complements are predicated are called
_copulas_.


Modifiers

Almost every word in the sentence is capable of having its meaning
described, restricted, emphasized, or toned down in some way—that is, any
meaning in the sentence may be characterized or modified.

    Heavy automobiles run smoothly.

_Heavy_ both describes and restricts _automobiles_.

Words which characterize nouns in this way are called _adjectives_.

_Smoothly_ describes and restricts run.

Words which characterize verbs are called _adverbs_.

    Very heavy automobiles run much more smoothly.

_Very_ emphasizes _heavy_. A word which thus characterizes an adjective
is called an _adverb_.

_More_ characterizes _smoothly_. _Much_ characterizes _more_. A word
which characterizes an adverb is called an _adverb_.


Prepositional Phrases

Nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs are also frequently
described or limited in the same way by an element or group of words
called a _prepositional phrase_. This usually consists of a noun,
pronoun, or gerund whose exact relationship to the modified word is
shown by means of a _preposition_. The preposition is placed before the
modifying noun or pronoun and its adjective modifiers.

    At home
    In the house
    With large tires
    Over rough roads

    Heavy automobiles with large tires run smoothly over rough
    roads.

_With large tires_ is a prepositional phrase, consisting of the
preposition _with_ and its object _tires_; the phrase modifies or
characterizes _automobiles_.

_Over rough roads_ is a prepositional phrase which characterizes _run_.

A prepositional phrase characterizing a noun is called an _adjective
prepositional phrase_. One characterizing a verb is called an _adverbial
prepositional phrase_.


Subordinate Clauses

A _clause_ is any part of a sentence consisting of a subject in the
nominative case and a predicate containing a verb in a finite form (not
a participle or an infinitive). Some clauses are used as nouns; others
are used to characterize or modify nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, or
adverbs. Clauses used as nouns are called _noun clauses_. Those used as
adjectives are called _adjective_ or _relative clauses_. Those used to
modify verbs, adjectives, or adverbs are called _adverb clauses_.


Noun Clauses

_Noun clauses_ may be used in practically any construction in which a
noun is used.

    _Subject_:               That he is a good workman is clear enough.
    _Appositive_:            The fact that the paper is new disproves
                               his claim.
    _Predicated noun_:       The weather will be what fate determines.
    _Object of verb_:        I saw that he had finished.
    _Object of preposition_: The book is satisfactory except that it
                               omits one essential feature.


Adjective Clauses

_Adjective clauses_ are those which modify a noun or a pronoun.

    Heavy automobiles which carry large loads run smoothly.


Adverb Clauses

_Adverb clauses_ usually modify a verb. They characterize the verb in
several different ways.

    _Time_:       He hurt his wrist when he fell.
    _Place_:      I put the glass where I could reach it.
    _Cause_:      We stopped the car because it was raining.
    _Concession_: Although it was still dark I awoke.
    _Condition_:  If you read widely you will not be ignorant.
    _Purpose_:    He broke the stone that he might find a fossil.
    _Result_:     He struck the vase so that it fell over.
    _Manner_:     They work as they please.

Adverb clauses of degree, and sometimes those of manner and of result
modify an adverb or an adjective.

    The cherries tasted sweeter than they looked.

    He sawed the plank as carefully as he could.

    We traveled so slowly that I despaired of reaching our
    destination.


Participles

The _participle_ is any form of the verb used as an adjective. There are
several forms: _rising_, _risen_, _having risen; raising, raised, having
raised, being raised, having been raised._

    The rising sun awakened me.

    The fallen tree lay across the ravine.

    The wind, howling a gale, swept the sea.

    Twisting out of my hands, he escaped in the darkness.

    The tree, twisted and broken, rotted away.


Infinitives

The _infinitive_ is usually preceded by its sign, _to_, but after some
verbs (_do_, _shall_, _will_, _may_, _can_, _dare_, _help_, _need_,
_see_, _hear_, _feel_, _let_, _make_, _bid_) and after the expressions
_had better_, _had rather_, it is usually the pure or root infinitive
without _to_.

There are six forms of the infinitive:

             _Simple_        _Progressive_        _Passive_
    _Pres._   to take         to be taking         to be taken
    _Perf._   to have taken   to have been taking  to have been taken

The infinitive has various uses:

    _Subject_:                To command is his ambition.
    _Predicated noun_:        To know is to act.
    _Object of verb_:         I prefer to travel slowly.
    _After nouns_:            We have work to do.
    _After verbs_:            He failed to pass his examinations.
                              He seemed to be in trouble.
                              Children had better be silent.
    _After verbs_ (with noun
      or pronoun subject):
                              Our neighbors helped us move.
    _After adjectives_:       They are glad to hear the news.
                              He is so foolish as to believe the tale.


Conjunctions

It is often necessary or desirable to join together two or more similar
words, elements, or clauses in a sentence. Two nouns constituting the
subject, for example, may have the same assertion made about them.

  Time and tide wait for no man.

_And_, which joins _time_ and _tide_, is a _conjunction_.

Two adjectives, two verbs, two adverbs, two prepositional phrases, or two
clauses may be joined together with a conjunction.

  The flag is colored red and blue.

  Time came and went.

  Men and women laughed and cried.

  The rains descended, and the floods came.

  The automobile is fast, but the airplane is faster.

Words like _and_ and _but_ are conjunctions.

Conjunctions which connect words, phrases, or clauses of equal
grammatical value are called _co-ordinating conjunctions_.

The most frequent are _and_, _but_, _or_, _nor_, _for_.

_Subordinating conjunctions_ are used to join a subordinate clause—noun,
adjective, or adverb—to another clause or to some word in another clause.
At the same time they show the exact significance and bearing of the
subordinate clause.

  We heard that the train was wrecked.

  He came because I called him.

  He remained though he wanted to go.

  If it rains I shall stay at home.

Subordinating conjunctions are also sometimes used to join participles or
adjectives to the rest of the sentence. In such cases, the participle or
the adjective modifies a noun.

  Though moving slowly, the train was gaining.

  Though faithful to his master, the dog was shot.


Structure of Sentences

According to certain features of their structure, sentences are
classified as _simple_, _compound_, or _complex_.

A _simple sentence_ is one consisting of a single clause or assertion.

  Time flies.

  Time came and went.

  Time and tide wait for no man.

  Men and women laughed and cried.

The subject of a simple sentence may consist of one noun or pronoun
with its modifiers, or of two or more nouns with their modifiers. In
the latter case, the subject is called a _compound subject_. Similarly,
the predicate may contain one verb or two or more verbs. Occasionally a
sentence will have a compound subject and a compound predicate, as in the
last example given.


Compound Sentences

A _compound sentence_ is one which consists of two or more assertions
of equal grammatical value—that is, neither assertion is grammatically
subordinate to the other or to any part of the other.

  The rain descended, and the floods came.

  The automobile is fast, but the airplane is faster.


Complex Sentences

A _complex sentence_ is one which contains not only a main assertion (or
more than one), but also one or more subordinate assertions—that is, it
contains one or more assertions which are grammatically incorporated as
a noun or an adjective or an adverb into the main clause or into another
subordinate clause.

  I saw that he had finished.

  Heavy automobiles which carry large loads run smoothly.

  The weather will be what fate determines.

  He broke the stone that he might find a fossil.


Absolute Elements

Most of the elements of a sentence have a clear grammatical relation to
one another. But there are pieces of structure which have no evident
relationship to anything else.

_Noun absolute_:

  He lay down, his heart heavy with sorrow.

  Hat in hand, he came down stairs.

The _participle absolute_ is more frequent.

_Participle absolute_:

  This said, he sat down.

  One of them having fallen, the rest ran away.

  The teacher absenting himself, there was no school.


Parenthetical Elements

_Parenthetical elements_, like _so to speak_, _it is hoped_, _it is
reported_, _they remark_, which have no grammatical connection with the
rest of the assertion, occur frequently. Sometimes they are inclosed
within dashes, sometimes within parentheses, sometimes within commas.

  This action, it is expected, will produce results.


Flexibility of the Sentence Elements

Although the sentence has a normal order—subject, verb, object; or
subject, verb, complement—it is rich and varied in the possibilities it
possesses of variety and rearrangement, especially in the position of
adjective, participial, and adverbial elements, and in the case of adverb
clauses.

_Adjective_:

  The gloomy and portentous mountains towered above him.

  Gloomy and portentous, the mountains towered above him.

  The mountains, gloomy and portentous, towered above him.

_Adverb_:

  The building may have been entered immediately.

  The building may have been immediately entered.

  The building may have immediately been entered.

  Immediately the building was entered.

  The building was immediately entered.

  The building was entered immediately.

_Adverb Clauses_:

  As soon as he had knocked, he opened the door.

  He opened the door as soon as he had knocked.


Inflections

Nouns, pronouns, verbs, and two adjectives show changes in function and
meaning by means of changes in form, by endings, or, sometimes in the
case of verbs, by prefixing auxiliary verbs.


Noun Declension

Nouns are declined to show case and number.

              _Singular_  _Plural_

    _Common_     boy        boys
    _Possessive_ boy’s      boys’

    _Common_     man        men
    _Possessive_ man’s      men’s

    _Common_     child      children
    _Possessive_ child’s    children’s


Pronoun Declension

Pronouns are declined to show case and number.

              _Singular_           _Plural_

    _Nominative_ I                   we
    _Possessive_ my                  our
    _Objective_  me                  us
                 thou                you
                 thy                 your
                 thee                you
                 he    she   it      they
                 his   her   its     their
                 him   her   it      them
                 who
                 whose
                 whom


Adjective Declension

Two adjectives show differences in number.

    _Singular_  _Plural_

       this      these
       that      those


Verb Conjugation

Verbs are conjugated to show person, number, tense, mood, and voice.
Most of these changes are shown by the use of auxiliary verbs, which are
placed before the infinitive or the past or present participle of the
sense-verb. The combinations are called verb-groups.

CHAPTER VII

SENTENCE CORRECTNESS


The language spoken and written by educated persons and by trained
writers in all parts of the English-speaking world has certain forms and
usages to which everyone must conform if he wishes to be recognized as
a well-educated man or woman. Conformity to the word-forms and to the
sentence structure of this widespread language is called correctness.

=300. Use the nominative case for the subject of every finite verb. _I_,
_thou_, _he_, _she_, _we_, _they_, _who_, are nominatives.=

  _Wrong._ Him and I graduated last year.

  _Right._ He and I graduated last year.
