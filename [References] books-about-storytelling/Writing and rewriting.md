## **TO INSTRUCTORS**
*Writing and Rewriting* is based on the conviction that college freshmen can be taught to see and to correct their own errors and faults.

Criticism by means of marginal numbers, referring to pieces of advice in a rhetoric or a manual, has long been utilized to economize the instructor’s time. It has not been generally realized, however, that this method, which requires the student to inspect and rewrite a faulty sentence in the light of an illustration in his book, is successful also in teaching him to rewrite faulty sentences before he submits his manuscript to his instructor.

The best device to encourage the student in self-correction is the preliminary copy or rough draft. This may be written rapidly in pencil on theme paper or on scratch paper, with lines far apart to leave room for modifications. After this is written the student should read it with his eyes open for the appearance of his pet blunders, and should do his own rewriting. If the rough draft is submitted with the finished copy, the instructor can discover whether the student is endeavoring to correct his own faults.

The best way to use *Writing and Rewriting* in class is to copy the faulty passages or to clip and paste them on cards. In class the student, using only the slip, may then be required to write the correct version on the blackboard, later reciting and specifying the fault, or the principle of style which is violated.

<a name="page_viii"></a>[viii]

In colleges where the marginal numbering of errors and faults is supplemented by personal conferences, the swiftest improvement will be found to follow the practice of requiring the student, before the conference, to copy his faulty passages on a new sheet of theme paper, to copy also the admonition indicated by the marginal number, and to rewrite each passage in accordance with the admonition. A file of these sheets will reveal whether the student is improving or standing still.

*Writing and Rewriting* has several relatively novel features. Chapters IV and V make it possible to criticize by marginal numbers the most common violations of the principles of the whole composition and of the paragraph. Although the admonitions criticize faults, the book contains few “don’ts.” Instead, the advice given is positive, constructive, and concrete. Each number refers to only a single fault. Few admonitions fill more than two lines of type. It has thus been possible to insert a criticism of every fundamental fault found in freshman themes. Probably every number ought to be used at least once in every hundred themes. The division of sentence criticisms into chapters on Correctness, Clearness, and Vigor is logical and obvious. The numbering of admonitions is not consecutive, but a new hundred begins with each chapter as a help in more quickly locating the number desired. Additional copies of the index to the admonitions will be furnished free on request to instructors who wish to paste it on a sheet of cardboard to facilitate their work in criticizing themes. The list of suggestions for subjects is a compilation of the practices of many successful teachers.

# **WRITING AND REWRITING**
<a name="chapter_i"></a>**Chapter I\
WHY LEARN TO WRITE**
-----------------------------------
The four main reasons for learning to write are:

1\. Writing is one of the best ways to make other persons think or feel as you do.

2\. Every educated person is judged frequently and severely by the correctness and skill displayed in his writing.

3\. The more you learn about writing the more you will enjoy reading.

4\. Good writing gives pleasure, not only to the reader but also to the writer.

1\. The ability to write clearly and convincingly will be of great help to you after you leave college. Whatever your field of activity, your ultimate success will depend in some degree on your ability to make other persons think or feel as you do. Writing is one of the best ways to attain this end.

Many professional men and women find that success depends not only on their knowledge, but even more on the skill and clearness with which they can present their knowledge. Lawyers write briefs and arguments. Judges write opinions. Clergymen write sermons. Teachers, doctors, and engineers get their new ideas<a name="page_2"></a>[2] before members of their professions by writing papers for publications of various kinds. The results of their experiments and researches are almost invariably presented to their colleagues in writing.

To attain eminence in one of the learned professions it is necessary for a man’s colleagues to think highly of his professional knowledge and attainments. It is not always possible for the leaders in your profession to know you personally, but if you can write they soon know what manner of man you are. The scholarly articles that a young professional man gets printed correspond to the home runs that are knocked by a bush league baseball player, but there is this difference. The sand lot baseball player may have made his impressive looking records against sand lot pitching and may fail dismally when he faces better opposition, but if a young professional man has the mental ability and the skill to produce contributions to knowledge in his field it makes no difference where he lives or under what conditions he has done his work. As he moves up to his big league he finds conditions more and more favorable for his continued growth and development.

College graduates everywhere are being expected more and more to assume positions of leadership in all matters that pertain to community betterment. Sometimes they are candidates for office; more often they are directors of the chamber of commerce of their city, or of some similar civic enterprise. Written statements, annual reports, appeals for public support for a worthy cause, letters to newspapers, circulars, and bulletins are almost the only way a public spirited citizen can get his ideas before the other members of the community. If he can write clearly and convincingly he gets things<a name="page_3"></a>[3] done that would not be done if he expressed himself haltingly and incoherently when he took pen in hand.

Up-to-date farmers and business men use printed and typewritten matter to get new business, to hold and increase old business, to adjust complaints, and to collect money. Every salesman has to write reports to his firm. Formal bids for all kinds of business are submitted in writing. Most busy executives prefer to receive the ideas of their subordinates in writing, and the subordinate who submits the largest number of good ideas in this way is the one who is likely to be promoted most rapidly. Many executives have to depend on letters and bulletins in directing large numbers of subordinates or in directing subordinates who cannot frequently be brought together. If you want to be paid for what you know rather than for what you do, learn to write.

Other things being anywhere nearly equal the man who can write gets ahead fastest in the business, political, or professional world. The man with a new idea—whether it is a new type of automobile engine or a plan for insuring hogs—can make a success of it far more quickly if he can write clearly and convincingly. The next time you see a copy of *Who’s Who in America* note the list of publications that follows the name of the successful man. The ability to write has dollar and cents value whether or not you ever wish to sell any of your manuscripts. You must be able to write to get to the top.

2\. Why do you suppose that almost every help wanted advertisement that offers a salary of more than $1200 or $1500 a year contains the phrase, “Apply by letter only”? The answer is that from one hundred letters it is easy to select the half dozen or so that come<a name="page_4"></a>[4] from persons qualified for a position rather than for a job. Applicants who write poor letters are never considered for good positions.

The activities of the social world continually call for letters—letters of invitation, of acceptance or declination, letters to a hostess thanking her for her hospitality, letters of congratulation and of condolence. Any new person to whom you write will judge what sort of man or woman you are from your first letter. Uneducated persons may have well furnished houses in the exclusive residential districts of the city, and they may wear thousand-dollar fur coats, but their written words betray the fact that they are not accustomed to associating with educated persons.

Students who can write get better grades in college courses than do students who cannot express themselves with pen, pencil, or typewriter. Written reports, term papers, and examinations all call for ability to write. It is essential not only to have the information that should be included in such compositions but also to be able to express your knowledge so that the instructor involved will know that you know.

3\. The better you write the more you will enjoy reading. You can actually know personally only a few persons, and they will for the most part be your neighbors and business associates. A love for good reading is the best friend you can have. Reading will make you intimate with all the great men and women who are now alive or who have ever lived. These great ones of earth—the clever, the entertaining, the thoughtful, the lovable, the brilliant, the courageous—have set down in books a permanent record of what they observed, thought, and dreamed. To get the fullest flavor and<a name="page_5"></a>[5] greatest benefit from the words they have put on paper you need to be something of a writer yourself. The writer best appreciates the good writing of others, just as the amateur musician gets more pleasure from a symphony concert than does the average person in the audience. The football player sees fine points in a football game that are lost on the spectator who never tried to box a tackle or elude an end. The girl who makes her own clothes can see distinctions in gowns that all look alike to her brother. It takes the craftsman in any field of endeavor to appreciate the work of a master.

4\. Your mother has, at the bottom of a trunk or bureau drawer, a bundle of letters that your father wrote to her when they were young. Every little while she reads them all again. She also keeps the letters he writes her now when he is away from home. Your letters to your mother will not be destroyed either. The better you write, the more pleasure you will give to the persons you love. Letters of commendation, congratulation, or condolence when done well are treasured for years, and are a never failing source of pleasure to those who receive them. It is worth something to give pleasure of this sort.

But the greatest pleasure of all in writing is the pleasure that comes to you yourself. To get real enjoyment from writing you should write on a subject you know thoroughly or on one that interests you—preferably both. Write without reserve; call things by their right names. Use care in selecting the exact word to express your meaning. Write clearly, concisely, and vividly. Be definite and particular rather than indefinite and general. Use incidents freely to illustrate your points. Be forceful and picturesque. Write so that<a name="page_6"></a>[6] anyone who knows you could pick your written creation out of a thousand written by others on the same subject.

Write something you are proud of and you will get more pleasure from it than from almost anything else you ever did. Even though you may not yet have realized it, writing is a great deal more fun than going to the theater, dancing, or watching a football game. The greatest thrill in life comes from seeing one whom you love create something. The next greatest comes from creating something yourself. Create something in writing that truly represents you and you too will experience this joy.

HOW TO WRITE**
-------------------------------------
The successive steps in writing are:

1\. Have a subject that appeals to you, and write for an actual reader.

2\. Gather all the material your subject demands.

3\. Arrange your material in the most effective order.

4\. Write as fast as you can.

5\. Revise, recast, rewrite what you have written.

1\. Write on a subject which interests you and one that you know something about. Good writing will not result merely from trying to satisfy an instructor. You can write well only if you have a compelling reason for writing; if you desire to convince, inform, or entertain a definite reader.

Know the state of mind you want your reader to be in when he finishes reading your composition. Write for a definite reader such as a college freshman, a high school student, an automobile owner, a ten-year-old boy, a proprietor of a retail store in a town of from 15,000 to 20,000 inhabitants. It will often be helpful if, after you choose the general class to whom your writing is addressed, you select one individual you know and keep him constantly in mind while you write. Thus instead of writing for a ten-year-old boy write for your brother Robert.

<a name="page_8"></a>[8]

Choose a subject that can be covered in the number of words at your disposal. If you are writing a four-hundred-word theme, “The American High School” is a poor subject. It would take a series of volumes to exhaust the possibilities in that title. Even eliminating a large portion of it by taking the topic “High School Newspapers,” “High School Debating,” “High School Dramatics,” or “High School Athletics,” helps but little. Narrowing any one of these subjects so that it applies only to your own high school still leaves you with more material than can well be put into a short theme. Good subjects for such themes are “The First Time I Faced an Audience,” “The Best Play I Ever Made,” “How I Felt When My Story Appeared in the School Paper,” and “The Most Exciting Play I Ever Saw in a Baseball Game.”

To take another example, “Cooking” is a subject broad enough for a Mrs. Ralston, a Mrs. Lincoln, or a Miss Farmer. “Making Desserts” is too comprehensive for any but an exhaustive treatise. “Making Ice Cream” requires at least a booklet. Good short theme subjects would be “How I Make My Favorite Sherbet,” “How to Make Chocolate Ice Cream without Cream,” or “How to Make Ice Cream Roll with a Frozen Whipped Cream Center.”

2\. Reflect, read, ask questions, observe in order to gather material which will enable you to carry out your design. Gather, as applied to material for writing, implies a go-and-get-it attitude. Gathering material requires a physical as well as a mental search. Do not expect material to come to you; go after it. Talk with persons who know. Read what they have written. Good writing is most likely to result when the writer<a name="page_9"></a>[9] fuses his own experience and observation with the experience and observation of others. Gather all the material possible without trying to decide, while you are getting it, what is important and what is not. Keep your mind, your eyes, and your ears wide open. Get details and get plenty of them. Steep, saturate yourself in your subject.

3\. After you have gathered the material, discard everything that will not help you to produce the effect you are trying for. Then if there are any gaps in your composition, gather more material to fill them up. Some writers get the best results by putting a plan on paper before starting to write; others let a plan take more or less definite shape in their minds, but do not try to set down any hard and fast outline. The reason for not making a hard and fast outline is that a curious thing often happens to any writer who has written much. He finds—on occasion—that his composition seems to write itself. The characters he thought he had created have minds of their own and refuse to let him treat them like puppets. His thoughts seem to be alive and to exist apart from him. They insist on expressing themselves in their own way. An experienced writer does some of his best work when he seems to be merely the medium through which ideas are seeking to translate themselves from whatever world it is they inhabit to this one. If, on the other hand, a writer is continually consulting a plan, his ideas and characters never take things into their own hands.

Write for someone to read. Put yourself in that reader’s place and see if your writing is producing the desired effect. Begin your composition with the details that will most effectively attract his attention and<a name="page_10"></a>[10] arouse his interest. Continue writing so that you will retain his attention and interest. Stop when you have said all you have to say.

4\. Write rapidly and at white heat. If pertinent ideas keep coming to you forget about your plan. Get your inspiration on paper before it cools. If you finally find a system—or even a lack of one—that enables you to write fast and at the same time to feel that you are creating something, do not let anyone talk you into trying some other plan. Stick to your own.

5\. Revise at leisure, but ruthlessly, in cold blood, and continue to revise, rearrange, and rewrite indefinitely until the finished product satisfies you.

Make the final draft absolutely correct. Avoid especially the common faults that denote the semi-illiterate man or woman. If you make errors that would not be made by a twelve-year-old child, your composition will get scant consideration from an intelligent reader. While revising, question everything, spelling, grammar, choice of words, punctuation; question the usefulness of each idea, and the arrangement of the parts of the completed composition.

Start writing soon enough to give yourself ample time for revision. Let the first draft get cold before you look at it again. If you wait several days after the first draft is finished you can approach your own writing as objectively as if it had been done by someone else. It will then be much easier to question every letter, every word, every phrase, every sentence, every paragraph, every idea, besides the whole composition and each of its parts.

Make everything in your composition justify itself. Whenever you are satisfied to do mediocre work the<a name="page_11"></a>[11] rest of the world is satisfied with the valuation you have set on yourself. Be your own severest critic. Show your own writing no mercy. Some of the world’s most successful writers of advertisements as well as of novels have rewritten their best work time and again before giving it to the public. What reads smoothly takes hours of toil to produce.

Many good instructors insist on receiving two copies of every composition from each student; one a rough, lead pencil draft, and the other the finished manuscript.

THE WHOLE COMPOSITION**
-------------------------------------
“Whole composition” is the name given to a completed piece of writing.
### **Preliminaries**
Go out and gather the material.

Write the first draft as fast as you can.

Revise everything you have written until the following requirements have been met.

<a name="para100"></a>**100. Indicate within the first few sentences what the composition is about.**

Some of the more common devices used by experienced writers in beginning a composition are listed below. You can begin almost anything you will be called upon to write in one of these ways or in a combination of two or more of them. Use a different beginning for each composition you write until you have tried a considerable number of them. After some practice you can quickly select the one beginning that is most appropriate both to your material and to your reader.

1\. Make one or more startling assertions.

2\. Ask one or more questions.

3\. Say something clever.

4\. Make one or more suppositions.

5\. Contrast one thing with another.

6\. Use direct discourse.<a name="page_18"></a>[18]

7\. Use an incident.

8\. Sketch in the background.

9\. Introduce one of the characters.

10\. Employ a preliminary summary.

11\. Plunge your reader into suspense.

12\. State the conclusion the reader is to reach.

13\. Give personal details about yourself.

*Better.* As he stood looking down the river he saw a house-boat plowing along. Turning around he noticed a fleet of coal barges sending ripples toward the shore.

*Wrong.* The taxi driver has an excellent opportunity to observe the life about him. All kinds and conditions of men and women make use of him at all hours of the day and night. Some think him merely a part of the machine he drives, some consider him no better<a name="page_19"></a>[19] than the dirt under their feet, and some—to be sure they are not many—treat him as if he were a living, breathing human being like themselves.

The Theater in America

Between the years 1750 and 1814 many events took place which either helped or hindered the establishment of a permanent theater in America.

One of the big events that helped establish the theater in America was the coming of the Hallam company of actors. This company was made up of English actors who came from the West Indies. The company consisted of twelve adult members and three children. Every member of the group had ability as an actor, and, consequently, the company was successful. They first played at Yorktown, Virginia, in 1752. Then, after a season in Philadelphia, they went to New York. After a three months’ stay in New York, they returned to the West Indies, where Mr. Hallam died. Here a Mr. Douglas reorganized the company and with them returned to this country.

Douglas, often called the “theater builder,” did much for the future theater. He was a man of great strength and courage. Besides being a capable manager, he was also a good actor. Douglas built the first theater in America at Williamsburg, Virginia, and the first permanent theater at Philadelphia. He also built theaters at Annapolis and at Newport.

The greatest difficulty which the play companies had to overcome was the increasing opposition of some of<a name="page_20"></a>[20] the people toward the theater. Throughout the country people were fighting against the theater. Especially was this true of the people of the North. The Southerners were fun-loving and pleasure-seeking, and the theater offered them a place of amusement. In many towns, however, laws were passed against acting. The opposition of the people was not directed so much toward the theater itself as toward the gambling and immorality which accompanied the theater of that day. Folders were distributed among the people explaining why the theater was not approved of and gradually the gambling and immorality disappeared. After this the theater improved and theater-going became better thought of throughout the country.

*Better.*

An Early Influence in the American Theater

In the year 1752 the theater in America received a great aid through the coming of the Hallam company of actors....

The condition of the theater prior to this time left much to be desired....

The nature of the company was such that its influence was decidedly good....

Naturally the effect of this kind of player was toward the betterment of the theater....

<a name="para103"></a>**103. Omit anything that will distract the reader’s attention.**

*Wrong.*

Scoring in Basketball

A score in basketball is made every time a player throws the ball into one of the baskets placed at each end of the court. In the West Branch High School the gymnasium is well equipped with everything the students need for their athletic contests....

<a name="page_21"></a>[21]

*Better.* A score is made in basketball every time a player succeeds in throwing the ball into the basket guarded by his opponents. If this goal, as it is called, is made from the field, it counts two points. Sometimes, however, one team is given a free throw at the basket as the result of a foul’s being made. If the ball is caged under this circumstance, the foul goal, as it is called, counts one point.

<a name="para104"></a>**104. Writing that is serious in tone or purpose should include nothing that will destroy its seriousness.**

*Wrong.* Gypsies are a peculiar, wandering race of people that appeared in eastern Europe in the fourteenth century and that has now spread out into Asia, America, and parts of Africa. These people are easily distinguished from those among whom they rove by appearance, by language, and by behavior. In appearance they are slight, though very strong; in color, somewhat tawny. In language they are thought to resemble some long-lost Hindu tribe. In behavior they are *sneaky*, and a number of them are not above *chicken stealing*.

*Better.* Gypsies are a peculiar, wandering race of people.... In behavior they are *untrustworthy*, and a number of them are not above *petty thievery*.

<a name="para105"></a>**105. Writing that is light in tone or purpose should include nothing that will destroy its lightness.**

*Wrong.* Many different types are in evidence around Fitzgerald’s boathouse in the spring. The type most frequently discovered, perhaps, is the lover. He comes, accompanied by his inamorata, in quest of a canoe, in which presently the two are drifting idly upon the ample bosom of Turtle creek. It is strange that lovers should sojourn here, for Turtle creek is anything rather than a background for romance.

<a name="page_22"></a>[22]

*Better.* Many different types are in evidence around Fitzgerald’s boathouse in spring.... Muddy water, sand dredges, a railway construction gang at work near at hand, the whole background is unheeded by the lovers—romance needs no setting.

<a name="para106"></a>**106. Arrange your ideas in some orderly sequence.**

Following are various kinds of sequence.

<a name="para107"></a>**107. Arrange ideas in chronological order.**

All day long we were happy as a wedding party.... Early in the morning.... When noon came.... At night....

<a name="para108"></a>**108. Arrange the divisions of the composition according to the relative position of the objects treated.**

As we entered the garden.... On the right.... On the left.... Directly before us.... Upon going into the house....

<a name="para109"></a>**109. Work from the abstract to the concrete.**

Freedom may be defined as the state of being free, but to how many of us is this actually illuminating? Let us take, for example, a man who has just been released from prison, where he has been closely guarded for more than ten years. What would be his idea of freedom?

<a name="para110"></a>**110. Work from summary to detail.**

When once the mania for news gathering claims its victim, everything he sees becomes potential news.

He looks for it on his way down town in the morning....

The restaurant at which he lunches is combed unconsciously for items....

In the lobby of hotels and theaters....

<a name="page_23"></a>[23]

Even his relatives and close friends become his prey....

Mohammed VI, the Turkish sultan, fled from Constantinople on a British warship, bound for Malta, today. The sultan declared he was not abdicating, but was merely removing himself from immediate danger. He was accompanied by....

<a name="para112"></a>**112. Work from the familiar to the unfamiliar.**

Everybody has noticed the way a cat’s claws are incased in tiny sheaths, but how many of us know why they should be? In the first place, the cat is descended from a wild animal whose way of obtaining food was to kill its prey and then tear it to pieces. Naturally when this animal struck into the dead body with its claws, the claws, being hook-like, would tend to remain fast. But nature found a way of overcoming the difficulty by incasing the claws in sheaths so that while the paw of the animal is still inside the carcass, the claw can be withdrawn into the sheath and the paw removed without hindrance. Perfection in nature extends even to such trifles as this.

<a name="para113"></a>**113. Work up to a climax.**

Now, as always before, it is the custom to give way to great manifestations of joy when the football team wins over a university that is much older and much better established. Just as soon as the report comes in that Drake is gaining, feeling begins to run high; when it is said that Drake is ahead, we begin to hold our breath; but when the report spreads that Drake has won, excitement breaks out like a vast tidal wave and sweeps everything before it.

<a name="para114"></a>**114. Weld paragraph to paragraph so that they will obviously be parts of the whole instead of separate units.**

Following are various methods of accomplishing this welding:

<a name="para115"></a>**115. Weld paragraph to paragraph by word connectives.**

On a summer evening the shores of Lake Tiberias are thronged with strange and interesting people.

Here are caravans from across the Arabian desert....

Above them a Bedouin drives his flocks....

Not far away a rich Arabian farmer....

Around him, around everyone, in fact, little Arabian boys....

... Guns, horses, motors, men, all thundered along the road, then, like dogs of war let loose at Armageddon.

The hunt was up; the scent was on the air—Germany was unchained....

<a name="para118"></a>**118. Weld paragraph to paragraph by announcing the divisions.**

The most attractive flower to me among all those that grow in my garden is the sweet pea, chiefly, I think, because of the delicacy of its color, form, and fragrance.

<a name="para119"></a>**119. Give each idea the space it deserves.**

*Wrong.* As the sun climbed higher, the spell of the dawn was broken, and the camp came to life. Soon the surface of the lake was dotted with bobbing heads. Upon the crests of the low hills farmers were seen beginning to plow. Milk carts rattled along the roads toward the creamery. All was in harmony to foretell a perfect day.

*Better.* As the sun climbed higher, the spell of the dawn was broken, and the camp began to come to life. Soon the surface of the lake was dotted with bobbing heads as the campers splashed about taking their dip before breakfast. There was much laughter and merry shouting; everybody was ready to have as much fun as he could. Across the lake the farmers were commencing to plow. And from the road behind came the rattle of milk carts on their way to the creamery. It was morning; the world was awake.

<a name="para120"></a>**120. Give each idea the position it deserves.**

*Wrong.* Here and there the long, shiny body of a fish shot out of the water and fell back with a faint splash. The lake changed from the deep blue reflected from the clear sky to all the brilliant colors of the sunset. The sun began to set long before it should have, according to the campers’ ideas. Canoes crept out without a sound from the shore, and the campers enjoyed to the fullest their favorite time of the day. Gulls called back and forth and settled for the night on jutting sand bars.

... With all these hints of prospective fun, how easy it is to bang the books back upon the table and let the world go hang—on Friday night.

<a name="para122"></a>**122. Choose a title that will indicate in a word or a phrase what the composition is about. Be sure not to refer to the title in the body of the composition as if it were an integral part of the composition.**

*Wrong.*

Friday Night

This is the night of all the week to which I looked forward with the most pleasure.

*Better.*

The Best Night in the Week

There is one night in the week that is, to me, more pleasant than any other. You know which one it is as well as I do, for it is your best friend, too.

<a name="para123"></a>**123. Plan long compositions as you gather the material.**

Use cards or slips of paper of uniform size for making notes while reading. During the early stages of your reading, the various topics which you will discuss will begin to make their appearance. Make only one note on each card. After writing the note, write one or two words in the upper left-hand corner to indicate the topic treated in that note. As you accumulate notes, keep them sorted according to the topics.

When all the available sources of material have been utilized and all the notes taken, arrange the various stacks—one stack for each topic—by first spreading them out upon a table so that you can see readily all the topics at once. Then move the stacks about, thus trying out various arrangements until you have made one which seems logical and complete. You will then have a plan for your composition.

<a name="para124"></a>**124. Revise for arrangement and development by making a plan of the composition after it is finished.**

<a name="page_27"></a>[27]

By outlining the composition you have written, you will be able to see just how certain ideas bear upon the subject and are related to one another. Again, the outline will show you whether or not the ideas follow any orderly sequence. But best of all, perhaps, it will enable you to judge whether the composition omits anything that is vital for complete understanding, or contains something that distracts the reader’s attention.

Following is a method for making a plan of the composition:

Strokes Most Commonly Used in Tennis

Idea to be developed: In order to be a good tennis player one must master certain strokes.

I. The service stroke

A. Position of body

1\. Poised so that weight be added to stroke

a. Leans away from toss

b. Follows racket in striking

B. Tossing ball

1\. Ball at arm’s length from shoulder

2\. Held somewhat before body

3\. Thrown lightly three or four feet in air

C. Striking ball

1\. Racket raised to strike as ball descends

2\. Force necessary

3\. Accuracy necessary

a. Ball must strike court within bounds

I´. Dimensions of receiver’s court.

Etc.

<a name="para125"></a>**125. Exercise.**

Following is a composition that is very poorly put together.

1\. Make an outline of the whole, using only the topic sentence in each paragraph.

2\. Strike out any topic which does not help to express<a name="page_28"></a>[28] the central idea. Reword any topic which can be made to serve its purpose better. Add any other topics which will aid in developing more fully the central idea. Combine topics that explain almost the same thing.

3\. Make changes in the arrangement of topics so that each topic will stand in its proper relationship to every other.

4\. Make an outline of every paragraph, using every sentence.

5\. Shift sentences into positions where they will serve better to develop the topic. Strike out any that do not directly apply. Reword any that can be improved by rewording. Insert additional sentences where they are needed.

6\. Shift sentences from one paragraph to another if they can thus be made to serve their purpose better.

7\. Copy the material in the regulation form for a composition, taking care that there is proper transition from sentence to sentence, and from paragraph to paragraph.

8\. Apply these admonitions to one of your own compositions and rewrite accordingly.

Why Take Boxing?

Boxing is a very interesting sport. When the child of kindergarten age first attends school he has his first experience with fighting. This happens at every meeting of boys and continues into the teens. Nearly every real American boy wants to learn how to protect himself, and a course in boxing is the best way to learn defense. In boxing, the individual learns where the best blows are planted and also how to ward off these blows. If a boy knows these punches he will not be imposed upon by his companions. Even in later life men often become quarrelsome and come to blows, but the man<a name="page_29"></a>[29] who has learned the fundamentals of boxing always comes out in the lead. If every man knew how to box, robberies would be less frequent because the victims would be less timid and would give battle to the bandits instead of allowing themselves to be held up by highwaymen. Thus, defense is an important element in boxing.

Moreover, boxing, besides aiding in defense, is a healthful sport. The body is developed greatly after one goes out for boxing as is shown by the increase or decrease in weight, as the case may be. The weight decreases if one has been in the habit of taking no exercise as he begins training, but the weight soon increases again as the body makes the proper readjustments. Persons who are fleshy soon lose their superfluous fat. With the adjustment of weight the muscles are developed. The arms and shoulders with their continuous exercise in delivering punches and warding off blows are highly developed. The muscles of the body are developed to a great extent by the continuous twisting and bending of the body. The legs become firmer and carry the body with ease after practice in boxing because of the rapid forward, backward, and side movements necessary.

Again, the body is developed in quickness by the practice of boxing. The boxer’s mind is made more alert by the habitual practice. The muscles of the body also increase in quickness. They respond instantly to the will of the mind and thereby increase the ability to advance and retreat rapidly, to deliver and ward off punches. When the boxer has developed this quickness of sensory and muscular organs, he can grasp the intent of his opponent’s actions more quickly and govern himself accordingly.

Boxing is a very well-known sport. It is widely popular both in Europe and in America. It originated several centuries ago. The main reason for the popularity of boxing is that it is a very interesting sport. The spectator is held by the rapid action of the boxers. In the early days of boxing the men were slow and relied chiefly upon strength, but the modern boxer has developed speed and uses short, quick blows. If the boxer of the past should fight the boxer of the present, the affair would be very one-sided, because the latter would soon tire out his opponent by his quickness.

<a name="page_30"></a>[30]

Besides being interesting because of the violent action that is a natural part of the sport, it is also interesting from the point of view of the money-maker. Thousands of dollars are spent every year in developing winners. This was shown in our latest match, the Dempsey-Carpentier fight, in which many thousands of dollars were involved. An international spirit also prevails when boxers from two countries meet. This was indicated in the same match when all the Americans yelled for Jack and all the foreigners for Georges.

Boxing has grown in popularity through the ages because of its aid to health and because of its interesting features.

THE PARAGRAPH**
-----------------------------------
A paragraph is an indented division of the whole composition. Beginning with an indention, and usually ending with a partly blank last line, it constitutes a visible block of material on the page. The successive blocks relieve the strain on the reader and enable him to mark each step in the advance from division to division of the thought. In length the paragraph ordinarily ranges from 150 to 300 words.

<a name="para200"></a>**200. Indent the first word of each paragraph at least half an inch. In typing, indent five spaces. Every paragraph begins on a new line.**

<a name="para201"></a>**201. The last sentence in the paragraph sometimes ends before the right-hand margin of the page is reached. In this case the last line of the paragraph may be left partly blank. All other lines must be filled clear to the margin.**

<a name="para202"></a>**202. Do not indent every sentence as if it were a new paragraph.**

*Wrong.* At that time they reorganized a girls’ basketball team which had been dropped two years before, and they made me jumping center.

Although our high school was not a large one, we played some very good games, and managed to make a good record for the four years.

In my last year we had a new superintendent who was interested in athletics, and we then had teams in basketball, football, baseball, and track.

<a name="para203"></a>**203. In representing conversation, begin a new paragraph with every change of speaker.**

*Wrong.* “Shall we go swimming after school tonight?” I asked. “No, I have to work,” John replied. “When can we go, then?” “Tomorrow night after school, or any time Saturday. I don’t have to work next Saturday at all.” “All right; let’s go tomorrow.”

“Tomorrow night after school, or any time Saturday. I don’t have to work next Saturday at all.”

“All right; let’s go tomorrow.”

<a name="para204"></a>**204. Form one paragraph out of two short paragraphs which actually constitute one division of the whole composition.**

*Wrong.* He always has a smile and a kind word for everyone. He tries to lift everyone with whom he comes in contact to a higher plane of living.

Much sorrow has come into his life, but it seems to have made him only kinder and more gentle.

<a name="para205"></a>**205. Break up a paragraph that is too long into two or more paragraphs. The subject matter of each of the new paragraphs thus formed should constitute a natural subdivision of what was originally one paragraph.**

*Tedious.* Just like all children, Charlotte was not perfect, either in school or out. While she was in the second grade, she was sent home for making paper boats during study time, a fascinating pastime which the teacher did not approve of; and while she was in the fourth grade, she and a friend were sent to the superintendent for a lecture because out of curiosity they looked through the window of the school room one evening after closing time to watch a naughty schoolmate get his paddling. The grammar school days arrived at last, and with them came the habit of giggling and playing, at the expense of lessons and the trying of the teacher’s patience and temper. During the first year in high school she calmed down and worked hard to establish a reputation. She was always very enthusiastic over athletics and yelled herself hoarse at basketball or football games. A great deal of her time was spent in reading books of various types and in out-of-doors sports. While she was a junior and also during the last year of her high school career, she helped her father with the book work in his office, thus getting a little experience along that line and also earning for herself some expense money. Commencement finally came, and she was graduated in a class of thirty-three with all the thrills and excitement which usually accompany that occasion.

*Better.* Just like all children, Charlotte was not perfect, either in school or out. While she was in the second grade, for instance, she was once sent home for making paper boats, a fascinating pastime for her, but one,<a name="page_34"></a>[34] however, of which the teacher did not approve, especially during study hours. Again, when she was in the fourth grade, one evening after school had closed for the day she and a friend peeped through the school room window out of curiosity to see a naughty schoolmate get his paddling. The result was a lecture from the superintendent the next day.

Grammar school days arrived at last, and with them came the habit of giggling and playing, at the expense of lessons and of trying the teacher’s patience and temper. During her first year in high school, however, she calmed down and worked hard to establish a reputation. She was very enthusiastic over athletics and frequently yelled herself hoarse at basketball or football games. Much of her time at this period of her life was spent in reading books of various types and in out-of-door sports.

Nevertheless, while she was a junior and also during her senior year, she found time to help her father with the book work in his office, and so acquired a little business experience and also earned some expense money. And finally, when commencement came, she was graduated along with thirty-three others amid all the thrills and excitement that usually accompany this memorable occasion.

<a name="para206"></a>**206. Avoid a violent break in thought within the paragraph.**

*Wrong.* At the age of five I entered the public school. The second day in school began the happiest days of my life with a good whipping. This whipping brought into my life the best friend I ever had. After eight years of the closest friendship he passed out of my life. It was then that the realization of what a mother could be swept over me. Until this time my mother had been a person to go to when in trouble. She now appeared to me in the new light of a pal.

*Better.* At the age of five I entered the public school. A good whipping, which I received my second day in<a name="page_35"></a>[35] school, not only ushered in the happiest days of my life, but also brought me one of the best friends I have ever had, Mr. Clark, the superintendent. During my eight years in that school he remained my closest friend, and it was not until I had finished there and Mr. Clark had passed out of my life that I began to realize what a real friend my mother could be.

Until this time my mother had been only a person to whom I could go when I was in trouble; now she appeared more like a pal.

<a name="para207"></a>**207. Discard any material that does not belong in the paragraph.**

*Wrong.* When evening comes and his day’s work is completed, he hurries home to his family. He is not extravagant in his home, but has it neatly furnished. If the weather is favorable, he takes them all for a drive in the country, or they go visiting, or do something else which he arranges for the pleasure of those he loves.

*Better.* When evening comes and his day’s work is completed, he hurries home to his family. If the weather is favorable, he takes them all for a drive in the country, or they go visiting, or do something else which he arranges for the pleasure of those he loves.

<a name="para208"></a>**208. The substance of a good paragraph can usually be summed up in a single sentence. It is often advantageous to put such a sentence, called a topic sentence, at or near the beginning of the paragraph.**

*Example.* *Of all the places for summer dreams the best is a California beach.* There the blended sights and sounds form a quiet setting for fanciful thoughts. The old Pacific rolls in its oily swells with only a rippling murmur; the droning roar of the surf a half mile down the shoreline rises from the tug of waves on tons of pebbles; the white hull of a launch is dipping, dipping<a name="page_36"></a>[36] far out upon the water, its regular exhausts sounding faint and thin. These sights and sounds are dreamy and far off; under the mood of them the quiet mind builds sweet, lazy air castles, to be forgotten and renewed.

<a name="para209"></a>**209. Arrange ideas in some definite order within the paragraph. ([**See 106-113.**](#para106))**

*Example.* A fence has been the evil genius of my life. It was not a remarkable fence, either; just a neat picket fence painted white. It surrounded a beautiful, well-kept lawn and guarded an old, pretty house which overflowed with books and toys. But the toys would sometimes become tiresome, and I would look wistfully through the fence at the children playing across the street. I would have liked to join them or to have them come over—but there stood the fence. I learned to read and gradually built up a play world of my own until one day I realized that I liked the fence. I no longer cared to play with the other children, and when I went to school I found that I could not play with them. The fence had followed me. The years outside the fence have changed me somewhat, but still whenever I am in a group of young people I have a feeling that I am not one of them. I want to stand back and watch them play. Some people call my backwardness shyness or timidity, others call it pouting and attribute it to a disagreeable disposition, but I know what it is: it is a neat picket fence painted white.

<a name="para210"></a>**210. Link sentence to sentence within the paragraph by using words and phrases of reference, such as** *he***,** *this***,** *then***,** *however***,** *of course***.**

*Example.* There is a delicacy about sweet peas that makes them more attractive to me than any other flower in my garden. Notice the way the blossom is joined to the stem. *It* is poised there with such nice balance that<a name="page_37"></a>[37] at the least puff of air the flower sways on its long green stalk with the rhythm of the wind. *And*, *too*, their delicacy of color is beyond that of most flowers. Really, the only thing I can think of to compare with them is the clouds at sunrise. If you have noticed, the colors *then* are fresh and vivid from the light behind the clouds, though a faint mist makes them more elusive than the colors of broad day. In the sweet peas the *same* airy, translucent color is repeated—the wan white, the sober purple blending into lavender, the rose in infinite variety. And there are other things, *besides*—the dewy freshness that clings to them all day, the coolness of them, the faint perfume—which make me think them different from the rest of the flowers in my garden and which set them apart from all the others in delicacy.

<a name="para211"></a>**211. Link sentence to sentence within the paragraph by causing each to grow out of the one preceding.**

*Example.* A university is an institution of higher learning. For purposes of ministering the better to the various demands made upon it, it is made up of a number of colleges, as the college of medicine, the college of law, that of engineering, of liberal arts, of commerce, for instance, each college being in charge of an officer called the dean. The colleges, in turn, are composed of various departments, such as the department of Romance languages, of art, and of home economics; these are under the charge of officers called department heads or professors. And finally, each department presents many courses of instruction, like French, rhetoric, European history, and architectural drawing, each course being taught directly by an officer called an instructor or professor. Hence, although from the variety of its interests and the complexity of its activities it would seem that a university is an awkward, ungainly organism, nevertheless, if one examines it closely, one finds that it is a highly organized and smoothly running machine.

<a name="page_38"></a>[38]

<a name="para212"></a>**212. Avoid an inconsistent change in number within the paragraph.**

*Wrong.* Here we find what amusements occupy his or her time. This is where their chief characteristics can be pointed out. Then a word here, an oddly written phrase there, or a lack of words gives us a clue to the nature of the student.

*Better.* Here we find what amusements occupy his time. This is where his chief characteristics can be pointed out. Then a word here, an oddly written phrase there, or a lack of words gives us a clue to the nature of the student.

<a name="para213"></a>**213. Avoid an inconsistent change in person within the paragraph.**

*Wrong.* One learns to like some students, of whom there are too few upon the campus. Others I dislike, and of these there are too many.

<a name="para214"></a>**214. Avoid an inconsistent change in tense within the paragraph.**

*Wrong.* My flower garden in June is a most interesting and beautiful sight. On a bright sunny morning one would stop in amazement; the flowers were so happy when the sun reached their faces, still wet with dew, that they fairly sparkled.

<a name="para215"></a>**215. Avoid an inconsistent change in voice within the paragraph.**

<a name="page_39"></a>[39]

*Wrong.* His directions were brief and to the point. Every question I asked was answered by just the information I desired—no more, no less. When dictating he used only the simplest words. All inquiries in letters were answered plainly.

<a name="para216"></a>**216. Avoid an inconsistent change in mood within the paragraph.**

*Wrong.* If you were to visit the library on Saturday afternoon, you would find it nearly deserted. The tables would be empty and the reading room very quiet. The students are upon the river or are enjoying themselves upon the campus. Someone, however, who has a paper to get in may be busy at the reference shelves.

*Better.* If you were to visit the library on Saturday afternoon, you would find it nearly deserted. The tables would be empty and the reading room very quiet. The students would be upon the river or enjoying themselves about the campus. Someone, however, who had a paper to get in might be busy at the reference shelves.

<a name="para217"></a>**217. Put the most significant idea near the beginning or the end of the paragraph.**

*Example.* Far as he could see through the gathering dark there was quiet, the reaction after tremendous exertion. Shapes of men surrounded him. Here lay one flat upon his back, his features sketched in sharp focus by the fading light. Three yards to one side sat two bodies leaning back to back, heads upon breasts, helmets over eyes. Beyond them huddled an indistinguishable mass. On the other side, so close he could have touched them, an arm and a leg strung along in a line—no<a name="page_40"></a>[40] torso within a rod of them. The world lay desolate and silent except for the yellowing moon and the far off, intermittent firing.

*Example.* My one worry and regret, however, was the fact that my father was the president of the school board. Part of my teachers gave me good grades because they were afraid they would lose their positions if they did otherwise, and the rest of them tried to flunk me because they thought they were not being paid highly enough. Among them all I managed to make about a B average, and the problem which now remains for the university to solve is, did I receive more or less than I deserved while in high school.

<a name="para218"></a>**218. Give most space to the most significant idea.**

*Example.* Since man’s progress through the ages is a passage from the undeveloped to the highly developed, one wonders what the buildings of a thousand years from now will be like. From that day in the remote past, when the first cliff dweller conceived the idea of enlarging his home by carving out another terrace in the rock above it, to this day when we have a skyscraper 750 feet high, man’s building has approached nearer and nearer to the clouds. As the little two-story terrace grew, the cliff dwellers wondered and doubted. Likewise, when a four-story building was a fact accomplished by our great-grandfathers, to live in a ten-story building would have been considered extremely hazardous. And now since we have the forty-story Singer building, will man continue to aspire to the clouds or will he remain satisfied with his achievement?

<a name="para219"></a>**219. Practice.**

Here is a paragraph that is very poorly put together. On the basis of what you have just studied, answer the following questions and rewrite the paragraph accordingly.

<a name="page_41"></a>[41]

1\. What about the indention?

2\. What about the right-hand margin?

3\. Should the speech of the mother be given a whole paragraph?

4\. Is it possible to form more than one good paragraph of this thought? Why, or why not?

5\. Does a break occur in the thought? Where?

6\. Should anything be discarded? What?

7\. Can you find a topic sentence, or must you compose one?

8\. What about the arrangement of ideas?

9\. Can you improve the links between sentences? How?

10\. Can you give more prominence to significant ideas? How?

Perhaps it was from her father that she got her restlessness. Accidentally she put her finger on the label of what looked to be the top of an ordinary hat, and the flat shape she held immediately took the form of a hat. Her only ideas regarding him came through an incident that happened when she was about fourteen.

She had never seen him, and her mother never mentioned his name. Her father lived in her mind as an ideal. She rushed, filled with questions, to her mother, for as long as she could remember there had never been a man in the house, and she had never seen such a hat except in pictures. Her mother was anything but romantic. She and her mother had been giving their house its fall cleaning, and she had found, wrapped up in an old silk comforter, what she took to be a hat—it was shaped like one except that it had no crown. “Your father’s,” had been the mother’s laconic answer, her lips drawing into a hard, straight line that forbade further questioning.

In this short discussion of grammar the attempt is not made to discuss exhaustively all the features of English grammar. The purpose is only to survey and to identify all the elements of an ordinary sentence. The definitions are few, and are descriptions rather than formal definitions. The parts of speech are treated as they become important in the structure of the sentence. Such a treatment of essentials as this is necessary partly as a review, but especially because a teacher and a student cannot discuss many of the commonest sentence faults unless they have a mutually intelligible terminology. A student must be able to recognize such grammatical elements as a subject or an object, a participle or an infinitive, a phrase or a clause, in order to produce correct and effective sentences. There is a minimum amount of grammatical knowledge without which a writer cannot rewrite his compositions so as to avoid the commonest errors and imperfections.
### **What Grammar Is**
Grammar is the study of the structure of sentences, and of the forms and functions of words and word-groups within sentences. In simple terms, grammar is the examination of the machinery of language.
### **Sentences**
Sentences make assertions (declarative sentences), or ask questions (interrogative sentences), or give commands<a name="page_43"></a>[43] (imperative sentences), or express emotion (exclamatory sentences). Written sentences begin with a capital letter and end with a period, a question mark, or an exclamation point.

The most common kind of written sentence is that which makes an assertion. This kind, called declarative, may well be taken, therefore, as the most available basis for the discussion of the machinery of the sentence. The word sentence in this chapter will accordingly mean a declarative sentence.
### **The Parts of a Sentence—Subject and Predicate**
A sentence has at least two parts—a subject and a predicate.

The *subject* is that part which designates what the assertion is about.

The *predicate* is that part which makes the assertion.

Many students earn their way through college.

It is obvious that *Many students* designates what the assertion is about, and is therefore the subject. *Earn their way through college* makes the assertion about *Many students*, and is, therefore, the predicate.

Although the sentence may contain other elements, although the subject or the predicate or both may be long and complicated, and although the elements making up the subject and the predicate may be variously arranged, nevertheless every normal declarative sentence contains these two parts, and can be divided into these two parts.
### **Subjects**
The fundamental word or element in the subject is a noun, a pronoun, a gerund, an infinitive, or a clause.

<a name="page_44"></a>[44]

A *noun* is simply a name word. It may signify a person or an animate being (Frank, boy, dog), an object (tree, box), a color (red), an action (walking, step, discussion), a quality (goodness), an abstract idea (truth, space), a general idea (speed, thing), to name only a few kinds of nouns. But it is always the name of an individual or of a class of persons or things.

A *pronoun* is a substitute or symbol word which signifies a noun which is either expressed near the pronoun or implied by the circumstances (he, it, who, anyone, I, you).

A *gerund* is a noun made by adding the suffix -ing to a verb (walking, hoping, sitting, being).

An *infinitive* is a form of a verb, usually preceded by the word *to*, often used to name the action signified by the verb (to think, to have gone).

A *clause* is a sentence element consisting of a subject (in the nominative case) and a predicate (with the verb in a finite form—that is, not an infinitive or a participle).

|1\. *Noun*:|Time flies.|
| :- | :- |
|2\. *Pronoun*:|He arrived late. Everybody was late. I can do it.|
|3\. *Gerund*:|Standing on the corner made him cold.|
|4\. *Infinitive*:|To tell the truth was easy.|
|5\. *Clause*:|That he hath wronged me doth appear in this. Where he stood makes no difference.|
### **Predicates**
The fundamental word in the predicate is the verb.

A *verb* is a word—or a word-group—the function of which is to assert something about the subject.

The tide rises.

The sun shone.

I bought a book.

The box is small.

<a name="page_45"></a>[45]

The verb may consist of one word—as in the examples given—or it may consist of a group of words, called a verb-group, containing sometimes as many as five words. This verb group consists of one, two, three, or four auxiliary verbs, followed by a form of the verb expressing the meaning or sense. The form of the sense-verb is an infinitive, a present participle, or a past participle.

The moon will rise.

The moon is rising.

The moon has risen.

He may light the lamp.

He is going to light the lamp.

The lamp at last was lighted.

The lamp has been lighted.

The lamp may have been lighted.

He may have been going to light the lamp.
### **Structural Parts of the Predicate—Objects**
*Intransitive verbs* are those which, like *rise*, make assertions the action of which does not involve any person or thing other than the subject.

*Transitive verbs* are those which, like *light*, make assertions which involve some person or thing other than the subject in the action of the verb. In the sentence *He lighted the lamp*, *lamp* is such an *object*.

The same verb may sometimes assert one, and sometimes the other kind of action.

The door opened.

He opened the door.

Some transitive verbs make an assertion which involves two nouns, both signifying the same thing or person.

<a name="page_46"></a>[46]

The club elected Frank president.

Some transitive verbs make an assertion which involves two different objects or persons.

I gave Frank an apple.

She bought Frank an apple.

I told him a story.

Here *apple* or *story* is the object directly affected by the action of the verb, and is, therefore, called the *direct object*. *Frank* or *him* designates the person for whose benefit the action of the verb affects the direct object, and is called the *indirect object*.
### **Copulas and Complements**
Still another kind of verb, called a *copula*, though it does not take a direct object, makes only part of the assertion. The rest is made by means of another word (or element) which characterizes the subject but which is an essential part of the assertion. In fact, the *complement*, as the element completing the verb is called, is the most significant part of the predicate; the verb is merely a bit of machinery by means of which the complement is turned into an assertion.

The sky is red.

The dark shape was a house.

The car looks cheap.

He is in the house.

Home is where the heart is.

In these sentences, *red*, *a house*, *cheap*, *in the house*, and *where the heart is*, are parts of the predicate, though they characterize the subject. Such elements are called *complements* because they complete the assertion of the verb; if adjectives, they are called *adjective<a name="page_47"></a>*[47] *complements*, or better, *predicated adjectives*; if nouns, they are called *noun complements*, or *predicated nouns*; if clauses or phrases, they are called *complements*, or *predicated phrases* or *clauses*. The verbs by means of which these complements are predicated are called *copulas*.
### **Modifiers**
Almost every word in the sentence is capable of having its meaning described, restricted, emphasized, or toned down in some way—that is, any meaning in the sentence may be characterized or modified.

Heavy automobiles run smoothly.

*Heavy* both describes and restricts *automobiles*.

Words which characterize nouns in this way are called *adjectives*.

*Smoothly* describes and restricts run.

Words which characterize verbs are called *adverbs*.

Very heavy automobiles run much more smoothly.

*Very* emphasizes *heavy*. A word which thus characterizes an adjective is called an *adverb*.

*More* characterizes *smoothly*. *Much* characterizes *more*. A word which characterizes an adverb is called an *adverb*.
### **Prepositional Phrases**
Nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs are also frequently described or limited in the same way by an element or group of words called a *prepositional phrase*. This usually consists of a noun, pronoun, or gerund whose exact relationship to the modified word is shown by means of a *preposition*. The preposition is<a name="page_48"></a>[48] placed before the modifying noun or pronoun and its adjective modifiers.

At home

In the house

With large tires

Over rough roads

Heavy automobiles with large tires run smoothly over rough roads.

*With large tires* is a prepositional phrase, consisting of the preposition *with* and its object *tires*; the phrase modifies or characterizes *automobiles*.

*Over rough roads* is a prepositional phrase which characterizes *run*.

A prepositional phrase characterizing a noun is called an *adjective prepositional phrase*. One characterizing a verb is called an *adverbial prepositional phrase*.
### **Subordinate Clauses**
A *clause* is any part of a sentence consisting of a subject in the nominative case and a predicate containing a verb in a finite form (not a participle or an infinitive). Some clauses are used as nouns; others are used to characterize or modify nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, or adverbs. Clauses used as nouns are called *noun clauses*. Those used as adjectives are called *adjective* or *relative clauses*. Those used to modify verbs, adjectives, or adverbs are called *adverb clauses*.
### **Noun Clauses**
*Noun clauses* may be used in practically any construction in which a noun is used.

|*Subject*:|That he is a good workman is clear enough.<a name="page_49"></a>[49]|
| :- | :- |
|*Appositive*:|The fact that the paper is new disproves his claim.|
|*Predicated noun*:|The weather will be what fate determines.|
|*Object of verb*:|I saw that he had finished.|
|*Object of preposition*:|The book is satisfactory except that it omits one essential feature.|
### **Adjective Clauses**
*Adjective clauses* are those which modify a noun or a pronoun.

Heavy automobiles which carry large loads run smoothly.
### **Adverb Clauses**
*Adverb clauses* usually modify a verb. They characterize the verb in several different ways.

|*Time*:|He hurt his wrist when he fell.|
| :- | :- |
|*Place*:|I put the glass where I could reach it.|
|*Cause*:|We stopped the car because it was raining.|
|*Concession*:|Although it was still dark I awoke.|
|*Condition*:|If you read widely you will not be ignorant.|
|*Purpose*:|He broke the stone that he might find a fossil.|
|*Result*:|He struck the vase so that it fell over.|
|*Manner*:|They work as they please.|

Adverb clauses of degree, and sometimes those of manner and of result modify an adverb or an adjective.

The cherries tasted sweeter than they looked.

He sawed the plank as carefully as he could.

We traveled so slowly that I despaired of reaching our destination.
### **Participles**
The *participle* is any form of the verb used as an adjective. There are several forms: *rising*, *risen*, *having<a name="page_50"></a>*[50] *risen; raising, raised, having raised, being raised, having been raised.*

The rising sun awakened me.

The fallen tree lay across the ravine.

The wind, howling a gale, swept the sea.

Twisting out of my hands, he escaped in the darkness.

The tree, twisted and broken, rotted away.
### **Infinitives**
The *infinitive* is usually preceded by its sign, *to*, but after some verbs (*do*, *shall*, *will*, *may*, *can*, *dare*, *help*, *need*, *see*, *hear*, *feel*, *let*, *make*, *bid*) and after the expressions *had better*, *had rather*, it is usually the pure or root infinitive without *to*.

There are six forms of the infinitive:

||*Simple*|*Progressive*|*Passive*|
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|*Pres.*|to take|to be taking|to be taken|
|*Perf.*|to have taken|to have been taking|to have been taken|

The infinitive has various uses:

|*Subject*:|To command is his ambition.|
| :- | :- |
|*Predicated noun*:|To know is to act.|
|*Object of verb*:|I prefer to travel slowly.|
|*After nouns*:|We have work to do.|
|*After verbs*:|He failed to pass his examinations.|
||He seemed to be in trouble.|
||Children had better be silent.|
|*After verbs* (with noun or pronoun subject):|Our neighbors helped us move.|
|*After adjectives*:|They are glad to hear the news.|
||He is so foolish as to believe the tale.|
### **Conjunctions**
It is often necessary or desirable to join together two or more similar words, elements, or clauses in a sentence.<a name="page_51"></a>[51] Two nouns constituting the subject, for example, may have the same assertion made about them.

Time and tide wait for no man.

*And*, which joins *time* and *tide*, is a *conjunction*.

Two adjectives, two verbs, two adverbs, two prepositional phrases, or two clauses may be joined together with a conjunction.

The flag is colored red and blue.

Time came and went.

Men and women laughed and cried.

The rains descended, and the floods came.

The automobile is fast, but the airplane is faster.

Words like *and* and *but* are conjunctions.

Conjunctions which connect words, phrases, or clauses of equal grammatical value are called *co-ordinating conjunctions*.

The most frequent are *and*, *but*, *or*, *nor*, *for*.

*Subordinating conjunctions* are used to join a subordinate clause—noun, adjective, or adverb—to another clause or to some word in another clause. At the same time they show the exact significance and bearing of the subordinate clause.

We heard that the train was wrecked.

He came because I called him.

He remained though he wanted to go.

If it rains I shall stay at home.

Subordinating conjunctions are also sometimes used to join participles or adjectives to the rest of the sentence. In such cases, the participle or the adjective modifies a noun.

Though moving slowly, the train was gaining.

Though faithful to his master, the dog was shot.

### **Structure of Sentences**
According to certain features of their structure, sentences are classified as *simple*, *compound*, or *complex*.

A *simple sentence* is one consisting of a single clause or assertion.

Time flies.

Time came and went.

Time and tide wait for no man.

Men and women laughed and cried.

The subject of a simple sentence may consist of one noun or pronoun with its modifiers, or of two or more nouns with their modifiers. In the latter case, the subject is called a *compound subject*. Similarly, the predicate may contain one verb or two or more verbs. Occasionally a sentence will have a compound subject and a compound predicate, as in the last example given.
### **Compound Sentences**
A *compound sentence* is one which consists of two or more assertions of equal grammatical value—that is, neither assertion is grammatically subordinate to the other or to any part of the other.

The rain descended, and the floods came.

The automobile is fast, but the airplane is faster.
### **Complex Sentences**
A *complex sentence* is one which contains not only a main assertion (or more than one), but also one or more subordinate assertions—that is, it contains one or more assertions which are grammatically incorporated as a noun or an adjective or an adverb into the main clause or into another subordinate clause.

I saw that he had finished.

Heavy automobiles which carry large loads run smoothly.

<a name="page_53"></a>[53]

The weather will be what fate determines.

He broke the stone that he might find a fossil.
### **Absolute Elements**
Most of the elements of a sentence have a clear grammatical relation to one another. But there are pieces of structure which have no evident relationship to anything else.

|*Noun absolute*:|He lay down, his heart heavy with sorrow.|
| :- | :- |
||Hat in hand, he came down stairs.|

The *participle absolute* is more frequent.

|*Participle absolute*:|This said, he sat down.|
| :- | :- |
||One of them having fallen, the rest ran away.|
||The teacher absenting himself, there was no school.|
### **Parenthetical Elements**
*Parenthetical elements*, like *so to speak*, *it is hoped*, *it is reported*, *they remark*, which have no grammatical connection with the rest of the assertion, occur frequently. Sometimes they are inclosed within dashes, sometimes within parentheses, sometimes within commas.

This action, it is expected, will produce results.
### **Flexibility of the Sentence Elements**
Although the sentence has a normal order—subject, verb, object; or subject, verb, complement—it is rich and varied in the possibilities it possesses of variety and rearrangement, especially in the position of adjective, participial, and adverbial elements, and in the case of adverb clauses.

<a name="page_54"></a>[54]

|*Adjective*:|The gloomy and portentous mountains towered above him.|
| :- | :- |
||Gloomy and portentous, the mountains towered above him.|
||The mountains, gloomy and portentous, towered above him.|
|*Adverb*:|The building may have been entered immediately.|
||The building may have been immediately entered.|
||The building may have immediately been entered.|
||Immediately the building was entered.|
||The building was immediately entered.|
||The building was entered immediately.|
|*Adverb Clauses*:|As soon as he had knocked, he opened the door.|
||He opened the door as soon as he had knocked.|
### **Inflections**
Nouns, pronouns, verbs, and two adjectives show changes in function and meaning by means of changes in form, by endings, or, sometimes in the case of verbs, by prefixing auxiliary verbs.
### **Noun Declension**
Nouns are declined to show case and number.

||*Singular*|*Plural*|
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
|*Common*|boy|boys|
|*Possessive*|boy’s|boys’|
|*Common*|man|men|
|*Possessive*|man’s|men’s|
|*Common*|child|children|
|*Possessive*|child’s|children’s|

<a name="page_55"></a>[55]
### **Pronoun Declension**
Pronouns are declined to show case and number.

||*Singular*|||*Plural*|
| :-: | :-: | :- | :- | :-: |
|*Nominative*|I|||we|
|*Possessive*|my|||our|
|*Objective*|me|||us|
||thou|||you|
||thy|||your|
||thee|||you|
||he|she|it|they|
||his|her|its|their|
||him|her|it|them|
||who||||
||whose||||
||whom||||
### **Adjective Declension**
Two adjectives show differences in number.

|*Singular*|*Plural*|
| :-: | :-: |
|this|these|
|that|those|
### **Verb Conjugation**
Verbs are conjugated to show person, number, tense, mood, and voice. Most of these changes are shown by the use of auxiliary verbs, which are placed before the infinitive or the past or present participle of the sense-verb. The combinations are called verb-groups.

SENTENCE CORRECTNESS**
---------------------------------------
The language spoken and written by educated persons and by trained writers in all parts of the English-speaking world has certain forms and usages to which everyone must conform if he wishes to be recognized as a well-educated man or woman. Conformity to the word-forms and to the sentence structure of this widespread language is called correctness.

SENTENCE VIGOR**
-------------------------------------
Good sentences are characterized by correctness and clearness, but the best sentences possess a third quality. Effective sentences must entertain, persuade, or convince. To do these things, they must be graceful, vivid, forceful, and emphatic presentations of the writer’s ideas. The quality which makes correct and clear sentences effective is called vigor.

<a name="para500"></a>**500. To emphasize pointedly, place material in a sentence by itself.**

*Unemphatic.* The city council is determined to stop jaywalking at the east entrance of the campus, and to attain this end has adopted a plan that calls for restricting pedestrians to clearly marked lanes that cross Clinton street at right angles.

*Emphatic.* The city council is determined to stop jaywalking at the east entrance to the campus. To attain this end, the council has adopted a plan that calls for restricting pedestrians to clearly marked lanes that cross Clinton street at right angles.

<a name="page_101"></a>[101]

*Attractive.* The collections at the museum, which is the most important in the world, are in two divisions, one for the public and the other for the use of specialists. Some specialists come from great distances to avail themselves of the unequalled collections set apart for their use.

*Revise.* That there will be no tolerance of laxity on the part of the freshmen concerning the observance of this decree was assured by the strong language of the order, which first pointed out that the wearing of the green cap by first year men was a college tradition and must be upheld, then explained that the wearing of the cap was left to the honor of every freshman, who was expected to purchase one and use it according to the rules of the past two years, which state that the cap must be worn every day until six o’clock at night, when it may be changed for the more common headgear.

<a name="para502"></a>**502. Condense wordy sentences.**

The book is made up largely of sermons.

<a name="para505"></a>**505. Begin successive sentences with different words.**

The physical training exercises which followed were of the type in which the regiment itself gives the commands and then executes them.

<a name="para506"></a>**506. Vary the length of successive sentences.**

*Revise.* The seven-hundred-word sentence used by the legislature, however, is merely an example of the prevalent tendency of people to disregard the elementary principles of composition and grammar. Everyone may have a faint recollection of having studied, at some remote period of his career, the important rules<a name="page_104"></a>[104] of “unity, mass, and coherence.” But in actual practice one too often falls into the habit of expressing thoughts in a rambling and unconnected flow of words, with the expressions embellished by slang and colloquial terms.

### **PRACTICE**
1\. Football is a game for the psychologist, and recognizing this coaches in the past few years have paid an increasing amount of attention to the mental attitude of their players. (500)

2\. The freshmen gathered at Lake Austin in the afternoon to plan the bombardment of B hall, and in spite of the fact that the excitement on the campus during the early evening promised an interesting conclusion to the day’s events, nothing unusual happened to break the monotony until half past two in the morning, when word was brought to the waiting sophomores that the freshmen had assembled on Brackenridge field and were preparing for the attack. (501)

3\. Francis Neilson will give a talk at eleven Wednesday morning in the room of the historical society. He will talk on contemporary political and economic problems. (502)

7\. To advocate the use of good English both in speaking and in writing, does not necessarily mean that one is a stickler for all the technical rules and eccentricities of the grammarian. Although a semicolon once figured as the essential question in a noted lawsuit in Texas, a person may overlook many of the rules of punctuation and still not cause any great harm to himself or to his associates. A split infinitive may be the bane of an English instructor’s life, but that error does not damn an individual to eternal perdition. The use, however, of accurate and clear English, in the larger meaning of the term, should be encouraged as a matter of efficiency as well as of refinement. (506)

WORDS**
-----------------------------------
New words and expressions, as well as new uses for old words, are being added to the English language daily. Likewise words and expressions once current are continually being discarded. The question that confronts any writer is, what words and expressions are now accepted as standard. In difficult cases only persistent consultation of the best dictionaries and a careful study of the practice followed by the best writers now living and by reputable publishing houses will furnish the correct answer. The practice followed by the majority of the leading writers and publishers of the present day determines good usage.

<a name="para600"></a>**600. Consult a dictionary to determine the meaning of a word.**

Be especially careful in using the following:

aggravate

alternative

amateur

among

asset

aught

awful

balance

between

borrow

can

claim

depot

expect

fine

learn

locate

mad

mean

nice

outside

over

party

propose

proposition

school

unique

<a name="para601"></a>**601. Distinguish accurately between words resembling each other in form, but differing in meaning.**

affect, effect

all ready, already

all together, altogether

allude, elude<a name="page_115"></a>[115]

allusion, illusion

almost, most

beside, besides

continual, continuous

way, ways, away

<a name="para602"></a>**602. Use words that exactly express your thought.**

Do not be content with the first word that occurs to you. Strive for concrete and picturesque words—words that will convey an accurate and vivid image to your reader. The search for exactly the right synonym will be greatly facilitated if you will consult one of the standard books which list synonyms. Some of the good books of this sort are those compiled by Roget, Crabbe, Smith, Marsh, and Soule.

Instead of the word *say*, for instance, consider *talk*, *utter*, *claim*, *affirm*, *shout*, *whisper*, *stammer*, *speak*, *lisp*, *giggle*, *maintain*, *state*, *answer*, *argue*, *laugh*, *preach*, *reply*, *respond*.

*Walk* is not the only word to express locomotion under one’s own power. Consider, for instance, *amble*, *fall*, *gambol*, *glide*, *leap*, *pace*, *prance*, *promenade*, *ramble*, *run*, *slink*, *slouch*, *steal*, *stagger*, *stride*, *stroll*, *stumble.*

<a name="para603"></a>**603. Avoid newly coined words.**

Particularly atrocious examples of newly coined words are *to burgle*, *to burglarize*, and *to enthuse*.

<a name="para604"></a>**604. Avoid using verbs as nouns and nouns as verbs unless such usage has been admitted into the standard language.**

Examples of verbs that have not yet been accepted as nouns are *combine*, *invite*, *steal*, *try*, and *win*.

<a name="page_116"></a>[116]

Examples of nouns that have not yet been accepted as verbs are *suicide* and *suspicion*.

<a name="para605"></a>**605. Do not use slang in formal composition.**

*Bad.* “Thank you for the ride in your auto.” “You bet.”

*Better.* “Thank you for the ride in your automobile.” “Don’t mention it.”

<a name="para606"></a>**606. Use words that harmonize with the tone of the whole composition.**

In ordinary writing avoid such words as *said*, *same*, *thereby*, *therein*, and *hereinbefore*.

*Bad.* Said rule is often broken.

*Better.* The rule just mentioned is often broken.

*Bad.* I received the watch and thank you for same.

*Better.* Thank you for the watch which has just arrived.

<a name="para607"></a>**607. Avoid poetical words in prose.**

Examples are *amid*, *anew*, *dwelt*, *ere*, *eve*, *hence*, *hither*, *morn*, *’neath*, *o’er*, *oft*, *’tis*, *thrice*, *’twas*, *whither*.

<a name="para608"></a>**608. Use unaffected expressions rather than trite or hackneyed ones.**

*Avoid*: a good time was had by all; bolt from a clear sky; beggars description; beyond description; indescribable; a royal reception; checkered career; discourse sweet music; dull, sickening thud; doomed to disappointment; exception proves the rule; fair maidens; the grim reaper; hungry as bears; last but not least; method in his madness; nipped in the bud; render (a vocal solo); sought his downy couch; stood like sentinels; stage (for anything except a theatrical performance); too full for utterance; took to his heels; wended their way; where ignorance is bliss.

SPELLING**
-------------------------------------
Correct spelling marks the well-educated man or woman. This simple fact constitutes the reason why one must learn to spell.

English spelling offers difficulty partly because it is somewhat archaic—that is, because pronunciation has changed since spelling became fixed by printers about three hundred years ago; partly because the English alphabet is inadequate—it has only twenty-six characters, and there are forty-two sounds in spoken English.

But however irrational may be the spelling of many English words, every student must master spelling. Nor is this a difficult task if attacked with persistence and determination. The chief obstacles are carelessness and lack of courage. Of the 450,000 words in the largest dictionaries, probably not more than one thousand are commonly misspelled by any one person—even the worst speller alive. Completely mastering a few words each day for one year, therefore, will enable any one to become a good speller.

But no short cut method has ever been discovered which will give skill to the writer who finds spelling difficult. Every separate word which he habitually misspells must be thoroughly and permanently learned by a distinct effort of the memory, aided by regular practice. Practice, in fact, is the only means of acquiring fluent and permanent control over one’s pet failings.<a name="page_133"></a>[133] But the memorizing and the practice may well be facilitated by an intelligent attack on the problem.

Human beings remember things in different ways, or in a combination of different ways. Some remember most easily and clearly what they have carefully looked at; these are of the visualizing type. Some remember what they have heard spoken aloud; these are of the auditory type. And others remember best certain motions which their muscles have performed; these are of the motor type. It follows that some persons learn to spell most easily by looking carefully at a difficult word letter by letter or syllable by syllable; others by hearing it spelled aloud or by spelling it aloud; and still others by writing it over and over. But of whatever type a person may be, he learns best by combining all three methods, and by assiduously practicing the last, for the only time he needs to spell is when he is writing.

The problem of spelling can be mastered by writing every word five or ten times while the writer has his eyes fixed upon the correct form and is spelling the word aloud. Practice on the same word for three successive days is almost certain to fix it for all time in the memory.

The weak speller cannot dispense with a dictionary. Asking a fellow student how to spell a word marked incorrect by an instructor is fatal, for the fellow student is often as ignorant as the questioner. Look up the misspelled word in *Webster’s*, the *Standard*, or the *Century Dictionary*.

PUNCTUATION**
---------------------------------------
Marks of punctuation are used for the purpose of making the meaning of sentences unmistakable. It is not sufficient that sentences be grammatically correct, clear, and vigorous; they must also be perfectly punctuated if their meaning is to be unmistakable.

I had been going to St Lukes Hospital in Charleston S C every day for two weeks to visit my brother John who had to undergo a serious operation Dr R L Spitzenberg one of the best surgeons in the city was in charge of the case one day it was I think March 12 1919 I asked the doctor when John might be taken home he exclaimed my dear sir how can you expect to move a man who is as weak as your brother is naturally I was disappointed but John was more then disappointed for he had become very tired of the hospital routine he sighed deeply he turned his face to the wall and wept sobbingly when he had become somewhat quieted a nurse came in with his evening meal she was rather small not particularly pretty and unusually brusque I thought in manner the meal consisted of a small well-cooked steak hot baked potatoes and a combination salad I sat beside the bed as he tried to eat and wondered why they gave him such heavy food if he were so weak finally I said nurse are all patients given the same diet not two minutes before she had been staring out the window in a vacuous sort of way at my question however she turned and with no apparent change in her manner remarked how should I know Ive just been taken on.

**Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™**

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

**Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation**

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit 501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

**Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation**

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit [www.gutenberg.org/donate](https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/).

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

**Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works**

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search facility: [www.gutenberg.org](https://www.gutenberg.org).

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
